For the first two weeks I was in total denial, I couldn't believe my business was shut down.


I distracted myself by obsessing about the life or death of my newly planted garden.


Otherwise, I've been experimenting in the kitchen: intensely flavoured eel and shiitake broth and a double cream brioche have been my standouts.


How do you unwind?


I won't get dressed up, Sundays are for loungewear, half-cropped tracksuit bottoms and a white T-shirt.


After a lunch of roast chicken, I'll snooze with the papers on a deckchair in the garden.


I try not to drink: it helps clear my head before Monday comes calling.


A Sunday that sticks out?


After a long Saturday night at my sister-in-law's 40th birthday party in New York, around midnight my heavily pregnant wife decided we'd better get going.


She was determined to enjoy herself, telling people it was her third after all.


We left the party and she went straight into labour.


And Sunday night?


By 7pm we've packed the car and have boarded the ferry to Portsmouth.


A drive up the A3 and we're back in London for the week: kids in bed, I walk the dog and have a bowl of cereal.


I'm good with leaving the Isle of Wight to head back to the city, I know if I don't, I can't have a home there at all.


Kenyan police officers arrested after fatal shooting in Garissa


Two police officers in Kenya have been arrested in connection with a shooting in which two people were killed.


The shooting happened at Soko Ng'ombe market in eastern Garissa county on Saturday, during a protest against the arrest of a man suspected of murder.


The two victims have been named as Aden Abdi Madobe and Muhiyadin Adow Shibin.


Kenya's police watchdog has launched an investigation into the shooting.


It will include "forensic analysis" of the officers' guns.


Garissa MP Aden Duale called the deaths "heinous" and condemned "police brutality" in a statement posted to Facebook.


Campaigners have raised concerns about policing during the pandemic.


According to Amnesty International, Kenyan officers have killed 21 people since March for failing to comply with coronavirus prevention measures such as curfews and mask-wearing.


Earlier this month police in the capital Nairobi fired tear gas and arrested several protesters taking part in the annual Saba Saba march - a protest event which started 30 years ago against the autocratic regime of then-President Daniel arap Moi.


Correspondents say this year's event was given extra impetus by anger over police crackdowns during the Covid-19 lockdown.


Tight Security Presence outside US Consulate in Chengdu, China


There was a tight security presence outside the U.S. consulate in the city of Chengdu, China Sunday, as the American staff prepared to leave the premises.


Three moving trucks were seen entering the building compound, while uniformed and plainclothes police lined both sides of the street, which were lined with metal barriers.


The editor of China's Global Times tabloid tweeted that the U.S. consulate in Chengdu was given 72 hours to close, or until 10 a.m. (0200GMT) Monday, July 27.


China charged that some personnel at the Chengdu consulate were "conducting activities not in line with their identities."


Without giving any details, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Wang Wenbin said such activity had interfered in China's affairs and harmed its security interests.


China's order to close the consulate in Chengdu was issued Friday in retaliation for a U.S. order to close the Chinese consulate in Houston, Texas.


Washington ordered China to close the Houston office "to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information."


As Chinese consulate closure in Houston took effect on Friday, a group of men who appeared to be U.S. officials were seen breaking-in to the facility through a back door.


Wang said on Saturday that violated international and bilateral agreements and China would respond, without specifying of how.


The tit-for-tat closures further escalated the tensions between the two countries over issues from trade and industrial espionage to human rights.


Safari park baboons seen armed with knives, screwdrivers and CHAINSAW as 'pranksters give them weapons to wreck cars'


The primates at Knowsley safari park, Merseyside, are long known to pounce on anyone pausing in the enclosure and ripping off a windscreen wiper or mirror.


Baboons have been armed with knives, screwdrivers and even chainsaws at Knowsley safari park, Merseyside.


Workers fear pranksters are arming the pesky primates, who are known to pounce on anyone who pauses and rip off windscreen wipers and mirrors.


Workers now fear they are being armed with the lethal weapons "for a laugh" by visitors to bolster their attacks and the apes have even been seen rummaging around toolboxes themselves.


One park worker told The Sunday Times: "We're not sure if they are being given weapons by some of the guests who want to see them attack cars, or if they're fishing them out of pick-up trucks and vans."


"They will literally go into people's toolboxes and carry them around. One of the baboons was seen lugging around a chainsaw."


Another worker said: "The baboons have been found with knives and screwdrivers. I do wonder if it's some of the guests handing them out."


And the baboon attacks are so inevitable that mechanics across the northwest of England have come to know the enclosure well.


One mechanic in Sale, Greater Manchester said people know what to expect at the park and that he has had two customers fall victim to the baboons this year.


They added that one minute kids want monkeys on the car and the next it has no registration plate - but the issue provides "good money" for the garage.


Knowsley reopened on June 15 with Covid-19 security measures after insisting it was as safe as a McDonald's drive-through as visitors do not leave their car on the five mile safari drive.


The 550-acre park, home to lions, tigers, rhinos, wildebeest and camels, dismissed reports of armed apes as an urban myth.


A spokesperson said: "We believe many of these stories have grown in exaggeration as they've been retold, with embellishment to make the objects that are sometimes found in the enclosure seem more exciting and unbelievable."


In 2012 car manufacturer Hyundai let 40 monkeys from the park loose on its New Generation i30 model for 10 hours to prove it had the strength for families with small children.


United, Chelsea into CL; Bournemouth, Watford down from EPL


Manchester United and Chelsea qualified for the Champions League at the expense of Leicester on a frantic final day of the Premier League season on Sunday, while Bournemouth and Watford were relegated to end five-year stays in the top flight.


United won 2-0 at Leicester through goals by Bruno Fernandes and Jesse Lingard to give Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team a third-place finish.


Chelsea beat Wolverhampton 2-0 after a goal and an assist by Mason Mount and finished in the fourth and final Champions League qualifying place above Leicester, which has been in the top four for most of the season.


Leicester, instead, will play in the Europa League along with Tottenham, which drew 1-1 at Crystal Palace to secure sixth place - above Wolverhampton on goal difference.


The battle to avoid the two remaining relegation places went to the wire as Aston Villa scored in the 84th minute, conceded a minute later, then held on for 1-1 draw at West Ham to survive.


Captain Jack Grealish scored Villa's goal in what could be his last game for his boyhood club.


Bournemouth did what it had to do and beat Everton, 3-1, but ended up one point behind Villa.


Watford was also relegated as the next-to-last team after losing 3-2 at Arsenal.


Manchester City passed 100 goals for the campaign with a 5-0 win over last-place and already-demoted Norwich, a game that marked the last in the Premier League for David Silva after 10 years with City.


Kevin De Bruyne got a record-tying 20th assist of the season and also scored twice.


Liverpool ended its title-winning season with a 3-1 win at Newcastle and finished on a club-record 99 points.


Also, Southampton beat Sheffield United 3-1, with Danny Ings scoring his 22nd goal of the season.


That left him one behind Leicester's Jamie Vardy, who won the Golden Boot as the league's highest scorer.


Gwyneth Paltrow wants kids to have good 'worth ethic'


Gwyneth Paltrow has said she wants to raise her children to have a good worth ethic as she tries 'not to just hand them things'.


Paltrow has two children, Apple (16) and Moses (14), with ex-husband Chris Martin and she wants them to have good values and not get by on their parents fame.


"That's why I think it's so important... To raise a kid that has a work ethic and whose values are aligned with yours or with their own sense of who they are, etc," she told Rob Lowe on his podcast.


"The truth of the matter is the doors can be opened for you, but if you think about all the people who try and it doesn't happen."


She added, "As a parent you think, all I can do for these kids is teach them right from wrong and teach them what work is. I've really have tried not to just hand them things."


Paltrow has also taken steps to allow her children to live as privately as possible, and ensures they keep their social media accounts private.


"I won't let them be public on any social media or anything like that, I try to keep them out of the public eye as much as possible," she said.


"You know, now it's different, 'cause kids are like, 'Can I have a YouTube channel?' and I'm like, 'No, you can't. Absolutely not."


Tunisia interior minister named new PM, to form government in a month


Tunisia's Interior Minister Hichem Mechichi has been appointed to form the next government, the president's office said, amid political tensions among major parties in the North African country.


The 46-year-old lawyer succeeds Elyes Fakhfakh, who resigned as prime minister earlier this month.


But Mechichi was not one of the names proposed by the governing political parties to President Kais Saied.


In a statement following Saturday's announcement, Mechichi said he would "work to form a government that meets the expectations of all Tunisians."


Tunisia has been praised as a rare success story for democratic transition after the Arab Spring regional uprisings sparked by its 2011 revolution.


But its leaders have struggled to meet the expectations of the Tunisian people and the already fragile economy has been battered by the closure of the country's borders because of the COVID-19 pandemic.


The disease has killed nearly 50 people and infected more than 1,400 in Tunisia.


As well as being the interior minister in the outgoing government, Mechichi has been a counsellor to President Saied, handling legal matters.


He has previously been chief of staff at the Ministry of Transport and also served in the Ministry of Social Affairs.


He now has a month to form a government, which will then face a parliamentary vote of confidence and will need an absolute majority to succeed.


Failing that, parliament will be dissolved and new elections will be held within three months.


In the last elections held in October, the Ennahdha party came on top but fell far short of a majority and eventually agreed to join a coalition government.


Fakhfakh's resignation on July 15, after less than five months in office, threatened fresh political deadlock in the nation as it struggles with the economic fallout of the pandemic.


The resignation deepened the political dispute with Ennahdha over allegations against Fakhfakh of conflicts of interest.


Relations between the 47-year-old outgoing leader and Ennahdha have been strained since the October legislative elections.


Fakhfakh stepped down the same day the party filed a no-confidence motion against him.


Ennahdha had initially nominated an independent for prime minister, but he failed to win the support of parliament, leading the president to name former Finance Minister Fakhfakh for the post.


Faced with the prospect of fresh elections, Ennahdha eventually agreed to join the coalition government.


Ted Cruz says Pelosi's objectives are "shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down"


Washington - Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats of pushing a coronavirus relief package that focuses on "shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down" as negotiations on the next measure continue.


In an interview with "Face the Nation" on Sunday, Cruz said the country is confronting two crises simultaneously: a global pandemic that has claimed the lives of more than 600,000 people worldwide and an "absolute economic catastrophe" in the U.S.


But Cruz said Pelosi, who appeared on "Face the Nation" ahead of the senator, " is "focused on neither of those."


"Her objectives are shoveling cash at the problem and shutting America down," the Texas Republican said.


"And in particular, you look at the $3 trillion bill she's trying to push, it's just shoveling money to her friends and not actually solving the problem. Our objective should be Americans want to get back to work. They want to be able to provide for their family."


Senate Republicans and the White House spent last week negotiating the terms of the fourth phase of the coronavirus response, which they expect to cost $1 trillion.


Over the weekend, White House chief of staff Mark Meadow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin headed back to Capitol Hill for more talks with Senate staff, and Mnuchin told Fox News in an interview Sunday the details are set to be unveiled by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Monday.


The most pressing issue for lawmakers - and a point of contention between Republicans and Democrats - is the expiration of enhanced unemployment benefits, which began to go away this weekend.


While Democrats want the "phase four" coronavirus package to keep the $600 boost to the benefits, Republicans are calling for it to be pared back and argue some Americans make more from unemployment than they did in wages.


Cruz said more than half of Americans receiving the enhanced unemployment benefits are paid more now than when they were working and said he's talked to small business owners in Texas who are having trouble rehiring employees.


"Of course, they won't come back because the federal government is paying them, in some instances, twice as much money to stay home," he said.


Cruz said Congress should be focusing on passing a recovery bill that would make it easier for Americans to return to work by easing taxes and regulations on small businesses:


"instead of just shoveling trillions out the door, a recovery bill would suspend the payroll tax, which would give it a pay raise to everyone in America who's working. That actually gets people back to work," he said.


President Trump demanded last week the next aid package include a payroll tax cut, but Mnuchin said it will not be part of the legislation, as the proposal was ill-received among Republicans.


Mr. Trump acknowledged the payroll tax cut would be absent from the next bill but sought to pin the blame on Democrats.


Cruz, who last week objected to the cost of the next package, said Sunday he is not on board with the measure from his fellow Senate Republicans.


But he also criticized the $3 trillion bill passed by the Democrat-controlled House in May and accused his political opponents of deliberately crafting a measure that damages the president ahead of the November election.


"The only objective Democrats have is to defeat Donald Trump, and they've cynically decided the best way to defeat Donald Trump is shut down every business in America, shut down every school in America," he said.


"You know, Nancy Pelosi talks about working men and women. What she's proposing is keeping working men and women from working."


Kanye West issues public apology to wife Kim Kardashian after marriage revelations


Kanye West has apologised to wife Kim Kardashian for going public with a "private matter."


The rapper revealed during an event in South Carolina that the couple had considered aborting their first child.


Following a tumultuous week in which he made a series of claims against his wife and her family, West has now tweeted an apology.


West also reportedly paid a visit to hospital hours after being visited by Justin Bieber at his ranch in Wyoming .


He said: "I would like to apologise to my wife Kim for going public with something that was a private matter. I did not cover her like she has covered me."


"To Kim I want to say I know I hurt you. Please forgive me. Thank you for always being there for me."


West's erratic tweets including claims his wife had tried to get him locked up by doctors and he made a series of accusations against his mother-in-law, Kris Jenner.


He also said he had tried to divorce Kardashian West, who he married in 2014.


Amid fears for her husband's state of mind, Kardashian West, the mother of West's four children, issued a lengthy statement saying she and her family were "powerless" to intervene and reminded fans he has bipolar disorder.


She said: "He is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressures of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder."


She added that she has not discussed his condition before because she is "very protective of our children and Kanye's right to privacy when it comes to his health."


She added: "But today, I feel like I should comment on it because of the stigma and misconceptions about mental health."


West made his abortion claims during an event on July 19.


Man Arrested For Allegedly Killing Alcoholic Brother In Greater Noida: Police


A 37-year-old man was arrested on Sunday for allegedly killing his brother, whose body was found dumped in an isolated area a week ago, in Uttar Pradesh's Greater Noida, the police said.


The accused told the police he was peeved by his brother's alcoholism and misbehaviour with women members of their joint family, which led him to the crime, according to officials.


The body of Bhisham Singh, a resident of Bisrakh village in Greater Noida, was found near bushes in an isolated area around a week ago.


The body bore stab marks and an FIR was lodged at the Bisrakh police station and investigation taken up, a police spokesperson said.


"During the probe, evidence led the police to the man, who died, his brother Deepak and he was questioned.


When quizzed, Deepak confessed to stabbing his brother to death.


He told the police that Bhisham would frequently consume alcohol, create ruckus at home and misbehave with women family members because of which he decided to kill his brother," the spokesperson said.


The accused has been arrested and charged for murder and other related charges, the police said.


Tony Blair vows never to stop meddling in British politics despite severe Brexit backlash


Tony Blair has pledged not to stop intervening in UK politics, following severe backlash to his involvement in the Labour Party and anti-Brexit campaigning.


Mr Blair, who has been out of office for more than ten years, told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that he will "never" stop speaking out in British politics.


However, the controversial political figure acknowledged "a lot of people watching this might think I should stop talking about things."


Sophy Ridge told Mr Blair: "I always get the sense you can't wrench yourself away from politics.


"You are always publishing reports on coronavirus or coming up with arguments on Brexit.


"I just wonder if people think, why after ten years of being PM, are you still trying to be involved in politics?


"Isn't it time to take some time out, go around the golf course."


The former prime minister rejected this and vowed to stay around in UK politics as long as he can.


He said: "It's not something I want to do. A lot of people watching might think that's exactly what he should do and stop talking about things, but I care about the country."


"We are at a huge moment of change in the world and the institute I built works around the world.


"I know I've done something that previous prime ministers have not done but in the future I predict many more will try to do."


Earlier in the interview, Mr Blair said that the UK and EU could still land a deal on Brexit before the end of the year.


He said: "They could land a deal. But even the deal we land is going to be bad."


"It's essentially going to be good for Europe because it will allow easier trade in goods but very inhibiting for us on the issue of services."


The former Labour leader also told Sky News the UK is going to be living with COVID-19, not eliminating it, for the foreseeable future.


During Tribute To Kargil Heroes, PM Narendra Modi Says Pakistan Tried To "Backstab" India


Pakistan tried to "backstab" India despite her attempts to keep friendly relations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said today in his tribute to the armed forces on the 21st anniversary of Kargil war.


In his monthly radio address Mann ki Baat, PM Modi said "Pakistan undertook this misadventure with sinister plans to capture India's land and to divert its ongoing internal conflicts."


"Pakistan had the audacity of trying to occupy Indian soil and deviate attention from its own internal unrest," he said.


"At the time, India was trying for improve relations with Pakistan.


But as it is said, evil's nature is to fight everyone without reason.


People of this nature can only think of doing evil even to those who try to do them good.


That's why Pakistan backstabbed India despite India's attempts at cordial relations," he said.


"You can imagine, the enemy was perched high on the mountains while our forces were fighting them from below. But the high morale and true of our forces won against mountains," he added.


"Thanks to the courage of our armed forces, India showed great strength in Kargil," PM Modi said, recalling his own visit to the area.


Kargil Diwas is celebrated every year, marking the day the Indian Army recaptured all the Indian posts in Ladakh's Kargil that had been occupied by Pakistan's army 21 years ago.


On July 26, 1999, the Army had announced the successful culmination of "Operation Vijay."


The nearly three-month battle in the icy heights of Ladakh had claimed the lives of more than 500 Indian soldiers.


Earlier today, defence minister Rajnath Singh, his junior minister Shripad Naik, Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, Army Chief General M M Naravane, Air Chief Marshal R K S Bhadauria and Navy Chief Admiral Karambir Singh also paid tributes at the Amar Jawan Jyoti at the National War Memorial.


In the decades since Kargil, India-Pakistan relations have been strained following a series of terror strikes.


India has insisted that talks and terror cannot go hand-in-hand and Pakistan needs to dismantle all the terror camps operating from its soil.


Online lenders warn SME loan scheme may miss the mark


The small business sector, often under-served by the big banks, has increasingly turned to online lenders to meet its funding needs.


However, Mr Callaghan said online lenders were disadvantaged compared to the big banks because they did not have access to the same lower priced funding and warned as a result the SME guarantee scheme was not gaining traction.


"I think it has probably missed the mark where all the people who call us, call in the expectation they can get very cheap funding rather than the government backing 50 per cent of the loan," he said.


"So they call and they get very disappointed because the expectation has been put out there that there is discount pricing and we look at our cost of funding which hasn't changed at all."


Mr Callaghan added if fintechs were able to access cheaper funding and pass that on to small businesses the scheme would be a "no brainer."


"It's been a bit of a Catch 22 the major banks have got access to the lower cost funding but they are more risk averse so they don't actually go out to lend in the same way, they can't get access to the data and they can't get comfortable unless you have property," he said "Until we can access that cheaper funding I think there is a fiction out in the market on how popular the scheme is going to be."


Melbourne-based Moula is also participating in the scheme and chief executive Aris Allegos said the benefit of the 50 per cent guarantee, implicit in the government scheme, should be passed on to small businesses but different lenders were handling this in different ways.


"I can understand there might be others who are not passing through that cost structure," he said.


"That might be a function of how their funding is structured and it might be a function also of which categories they are lending into and how they assess risk within those categories."


Mr Allegos would not provide details of the number of loans Moula had issued under the scheme but said the revamped scheme was "a core recognition of what needed to change" to offer more flexibility to lenders and borrowers.


However, he said his major concern was the "two speed economy" that was operating and the impact this would have on small businesses.


"The biggest issue Moula has to face and lenders with respect to small businesses is that proverbial cliff and how to manage into that cliff," he said.


"Generally speaking with respect to demand we have not returned to pre-COVID levels although appetite is growing."


ASX-listed online lender Prospa also would not detail the amount of loans it had issued under the scheme as it said the information was commercially sensitive but chief executive Greg Moshal said the goverment's extension of the scheme was welcome.


"We support any enhancements to the scheme that will enable small businesses to access a wide range of funding products that meet their requirements, including flexible cash flow products over shorter terms," he said.


I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that, by far, most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light.


We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes.


The Sun burns our peripheral vision.


We see light reflected off the Moon.


And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies, the known universe has come to us through light, across vast eras in cosmic history.


And with all of our modern telescopes, we've been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang.


And yet, the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn't silent.


I'd like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself, because space can wobble like a drum.


It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold.


Now we'd like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition.


And while we've never heard the sounds from space, we really should, in the next few years, start to turn up the volume on what's going on out there.


So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe, we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have, because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song, which I'd like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like.


We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background, but we haven't yet.


And yet black holes may be heard even if they're not seen, and that's because they bang on space-time like a drum.


Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much.


Einstein realized that if space were empty, if the universe were empty, it would be like this picture, except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it.


But if we were freely falling through the space, even without this helpful grid, we might be able to paint it ourselves, because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines, undeflected straight paths through the universe.


Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe, it would curve space, and a freely falling object would pass by, let's say, the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space.


It was Einstein's great general theory of relativity.


Now even light will be bent by those paths.


And you can be bent so much that you're caught in orbit around the Sun, as the Earth is, or the Moon around the Earth.


These are the natural curves in space.


What Einstein did not realize was that, if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across, you would make a black hole, an object so dense that if light veered too close, it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe.


But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity.


He did not believe they existed in nature.


He thought nature would protect us from their formation.


It was decades before the term "black hole" was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they're the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime.


Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole.


It's actually not massive enough.


But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers, and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit, maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun.


And it would be self-illuminated, because now the Sun's gone, we have no other source of light -- so let's make our little Earth self-illuminated.


And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole.


This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan, more or less.


It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth.


But basically that's what we're talking about.


We're talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan.


So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it's perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole.


There's a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe, but you actually have to get very close to fall in.


But what's very impressive is that, from our vantage point, we can always see the Earth.


It cannot hide behind the black hole.


The light from the Earth, some of it falls in, but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us.


So you can't hide anything behind a black hole.


If this were Battlestar Galactica and you're fighting the Cylons, don't hide behind the black hole.


They can see you.


Now, our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it's not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy.


And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way, this is what it would look like.


We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes.


And if we were to fall towards this black hole, we would see all of that light lensed around it, and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened.


It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn't, anymore than light can escape.


But even though the black hole is dark from the outside, it's not dark on the inside, because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us.


And even though, due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation, our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time, it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us, right before we were crushed to death by the black hole.


It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's a total death experience.


(Laughter) And there's no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel.


Now we've never seen a shadow like this of a black hole, but black holes can be heard, even if they're not seen.


Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together.


Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun.


So now we're going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across.


They can be spinning hundreds of times a second.


At the end of their lives, they're going around each other very near the speed of light.


So they're crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second, and as they do so, they not only curve space, but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space, an actual wave on space-time.


Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe.


And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light.


This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard.


It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem.


This was one of the groups.


It shows two black holes in orbit around each other, again, with these helpfully painted curves.


And if you can see -- it's kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out, those are the gravitational waves.


They're literally the sounds of space ringing, and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning, quiet black hole at the end of the day.


If you were standing near enough, your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space.


You would literally hear the sound.


Now of course, your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully, so you might have trouble understanding what's going on.


But I'd like to play for you the sound that we predict.


This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling.


Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole.


The sound you're hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close.


If it gets far away, it's a little too quiet.


But it comes in like a mallet, and it literally cracks space, wobbling it like a drum.


And we can predict what the sound will be.


We know that, as it falls in, it gets faster and it gets louder.


And eventually, we're going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy.


Now I've never heard it that loud -- it's actually more dramatic.


At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic.


It's sort of like ding, ding, ding.


This is another sound from my group.


No, I'm not showing you any images, because black holes don't leave behind helpful trails of ink, and space is not painted, showing you the curves.


But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this, you want to get moving.


(Laughter) Want to get away from the sound.


Both black holes are moving.


Both black holes are getting closer together.


In this case, they're both wobbling quite a lot.


And then they're going to merge.


Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end.


Now that's our prediction for what we'll see.


Luckily we're at this safe distance in Long Beach, California.


And surely, somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged.


And surely, the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years, or a million years, at the speed of light to get to us.


But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear.


There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers.


It's a remarkably ambitious experiment, and it's going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up.


There's also a mission proposed for space, which hopefully will launch in the next ten years, called LISA.


And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun.


In this Hubble image, we see two galaxies.


They look like they're frozen in some embrace.


And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core.


But they're not frozen; they're actually merging.


These two black holes are colliding, and they will merge over a billion-year time scale.


It's beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration.


But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe's history, the last 15 minutes before they fall together.


And it's not just black holes, but it's also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang.


When that expression was coined, it was derisive -- like, "Oh, who would believe in a Big Bang?"


This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside.


We don't ever want to do that actually. We want to be inside the universe because there's no such thing as standing outside the universe.


So imagine you're inside the Big Bang.


It's everywhere, it's all around you, and the space is wobbling chaotically.


Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us.


Galaxies form, and generations of stars form in those galaxies, and around one star, at least one star, is a habitable planet.


And here we are frantically building these experiments, doing these calculations, writing these computer codes.


Imagine a billion years ago, two black holes collided.


That song has been ringing through space for all that time.


We weren't even here.


It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago, we're still doing cave paintings.


If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up, it would sound like this.


It's literally the definition of noise.


It's white noise; it's such a chaotic ringing.


But it's around us everywhere, presumably, if it hasn't been wiped out by some other process in the universe.


And if we pick it up, it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation, of our observable universe.


So within the next few years, we'll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit, render the universe in audio.


But if we detect those earliest moments, it'll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang, which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest, most elusive, questions.


If we run the movie of our universe backwards, we know that there was a Big Bang in our past, and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it, but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang?


I mean we have to ask, has it happened before?


Will it happen again?


I mean, in the spirit of rising to TED's challenge to reignite wonder, we can ask questions, at least for this last minute, that honestly might evade us forever.


But we have to ask: Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history?


Or, is it possible that we're just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums, maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life, and maybe some without -- not in our past, not in our future, but somehow fundamentally connected to us?


So we have to wonder, if there is a multiverse, in some other patch of that multiverse, are there creatures?


Here's my multiverse creatures.


Are there other creatures in the multiverse, wondering about us and wondering about their own origins?


And if they are, I can imagine them as we are, calculating, writing computer code, building instruments, trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there.


Thank you. Thank you.

Virginia Beach takes down Confederate monument


VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. -- The city of Virginia Beach removed a 115-year-old Confederate monument from public grounds on Saturday, less than two days after the City Council voted unanimously to do so.


Workers took down the 27-foot (8.2-meter) tall monument on Saturday morning, media outlets reported.


It was installed in 1905 and stood outside the old Princess Anne County courthouse, in the same place that slave auctions were once held.


The council voted unanimously Thursday night to begin the removal process.


The council had listened to dozens of speakers and decided the monument is viewed by many as divisive and a painful reminder of the past.


The statue recently had been completely covered, with a locked gate around it following recent protests and vandalism at other Confederate monuments.


The monument will be stored for now.


The city now must wait for any offers from historical groups or other entities that might want to take the monument.


Police try new, less-lethal tools as protests continue


As violent clashes continue between law enforcement and protesters in Portland and around the country, debate is swirling around how police can cut back on lethal force.


Some companies are stepping up to offer new high-tech tools like remote handcuffs for police to use instead of the more dangerous options like pepper spray, rubber bullets and flash grenades.


Human rights group Amnesty International analyzed 500 videos from protests from May 26 through June 5 and found 125 incidents of excessive force across 40 states and the District of Columbia.


"We saw a misuse of tear gas, pepper spray, pepper balls, 40 millimeter impact rounds, basically every combination of less-lethal weapon being used in inappropriate ways," said Amnesty International weapons investigator Brian Castner.


Still, some insist that having options is important for avoiding the need for a firearm.


"All of these devices should be at hand for the cops to use other than deadly physical force being used by a firearm because it's the only profession in America where the citizens give you the right to take your life," said Corey Pegues, former New York Police Department Deputy Inspector.


One of the newest tools is called the Bola Wrap, a handheld device that shoots out an 8-foot Kevlar cord that wraps around a suspect.


There are Long Range Acoustic Devices, also known as sound canons, directed energy weapons that use lasers to heat a person's skin, new projectiles made from things like foam and chalk, stink bombs, and of course the Taser.


Shares of Axon, the company that makes the Taser, spiked more than 18%, reaching all-time highs when protests turned violent days after the police killing of George Floyd.


The market for less-lethal weapons is expected to reach $11.85 billion by 2023.


Watch the video to get a look at the new high-tech tools police are using for less-lethal force, how they're regulated, and what's at stake for the future of policing and the communities they serve.


UN says thousands of anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan


ISLAMABAD -- A U.N. report says more than 6,000 Pakistani insurgents are hiding in Afghanistan, most belonging to the outlawed Pakistani Taliban group responsible for attacking Pakistani military and civilian targets.


The report released this week said the group, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), has linked up with the Afghan-based affiliate of the Islamic State group.


Some of TTP's members have even joined the IS affiliate, which has its headquarters in eastern Afghanistan.


The Afghan government did not respond Sunday to requests by The Associated Press for comment.


The report said IS in Afghanistan, known as IS in Khorasan province, has been hit hard by Afghan security forces as well as U.S. and NATO forces, and even on occasion by the Afghan Taliban.


The report was prepared by the U.N. analytical and sanctions monitoring team, which tracks terrorist groups around the world.


The report estimated the membership of IS in Afghanistan at 2,200, and while its leadership has been depleted, IS still counts among its leaders a Syrian national Abu Said Mohammad al-Khorasani.


The report also said the monitoring team had received information that two senior Islamic State commanders, Abu Qutaibah and Abu Hajar al-Iraqi, had recently arrived in Afghanistan from the Middle East.


"Although in territorial retreat, (the Islamic State) remains capable of carrying out high-profile attacks in various parts of the country, including Kabul.


It also aims to attract Taliban fighters who oppose the agreement with the United States," the report said, referring to a U.S. peace deal signed with the Taliban in February.


That deal was struck to allow the U.S. to end its 19-year involvement in Afghanistan, and calls on the Taliban to guarantee its territory will not be used by terrorist groups.


The deal is also expected to guarantee the Taliban's all-out participation in the fight against IS.


The second and perhaps most critical part of the agreement calls for talks between the Taliban and Kabul's political leadership.


Late Saturday, the U.S. State Department issued a statement saying its peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was again shuttling through the region seeking to jump start those negotiations, which have been repeatedly postponed as both sides squabble over a prisoner release program.


The U.S.-backed deal calls for the Afghan government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners and the Taliban to free 1,000 government and military personnel as a so-called good will gesture ahead of talks.


Until now the government is refusing to release nearly 600 Taliban prisoners it calls high-profile criminals and has offered to free alternatives.


The Taliban have refused.


"The parties are closer than ever to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, the key next step to ending Afghanistan's 40-year long war," said the U.S. State Department statement.


"Although significant progress has been made on prisoner exchanges, the issue requires additional effort to fully resolve."


The Taliban's political spokesman earlier this week said it was ready to hold talks with Kabul's political leaders after the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha at the end of the month, providing the prisoner release is completed.


A big worry for Pakistan is the presence in Afghanistan of militants, particularly linked to the TTP or Jamaat-ul-Ahrar or Lashkar-e-Islam, as well as those with the Baluchistan Liberation Army, which has taken responsibility for high-profile attacks this month in the southern Sindh province as well as in southwestern Baluchistan Province.


Several Pakistan military personnel have been killed this month in southwestern Baluchistan province in battle with insurgents.


The TTP took responsibility for one of the most horrific attacks in Pakistan in 2014, when a Pakistani army school was attacked and 140 were killed.


Most were students, and some were as young as 5.


"The total number of Pakistani foreign terrorist fighters in Afghanistan, posing a threat to both countries, is estimated at between 6,000 and 6,500, most of them with TTP," the report said.


I work on helping computers communicate about the world around us.


There are a lot of ways to do this, and I like to focus on helping computers to talk about what they see and understand.


Given a scene like this, a modern computer-vision algorithm can tell you that there's a woman and there's a dog.


It can tell you that the woman is smiling.


It might even be able to tell you that the dog is incredibly cute.


I work on this problem thinking about how humans understand and process the world.


The thoughts, memories and stories that a scene like this might evoke for humans.


All the interconnections of related situations.


Maybe you've seen a dog like this one before, or you've spent time running on a beach like this one, and that further evokes thoughts and memories of a past vacation, past times to the beach, times spent running around with other dogs.


One of my guiding principles is that by helping computers to understand what it's like to have these experiences, to understand what we share and believe and feel, then we're in a great position to start evolving computer technology in a way that's complementary with our own experiences.


So, digging more deeply into this, a few years ago I began working on helping computers to generate human-like stories from sequences of images.


So, one day, I was working with my computer to ask it what it thought about a trip to Australia.


It took a look at the pictures, and it saw a koala.


It didn't know what the koala was, but it said it thought it was an interesting-looking creature.


Then I shared with it a sequence of images about a house burning down.


It took a look at the images and it said, "This is an amazing view! This is spectacular!"


It sent chills down my spine.


It saw a horrible, life-changing and life-destroying event and thought it was something positive.


I realized that it recognized the contrast, the reds, the yellows, and thought it was something worth remarking on positively.


And part of why it was doing this was because most of the images I had given it were positive images.


That's because people tend to share positive images when they talk about their experiences.


When was the last time you saw a selfie at a funeral?


I realized that, as I worked on improving AI task by task, dataset by dataset, that I was creating massive gaps, holes and blind spots in what it could understand.


And while doing so, I was encoding all kinds of biases.


Biases that reflect a limited viewpoint, limited to a single dataset -- biases that can reflect human biases found in the data, such as prejudice and stereotyping.


I thought back to the evolution of the technology that brought me to where I was that day -- how the first color images were calibrated against a white woman's skin, meaning that color photography was biased against black faces.


And that same bias, that same blind spot continued well into the '90s.


And the same blind spot continues even today in how well we can recognize different people's faces in facial recognition technology.


I though about the state of the art in research today, where we tend to limit our thinking to one dataset and one problem.


And that in doing so, we were creating more blind spots and biases that the AI could further amplify.


I realized then that we had to think deeply about how the technology we work on today looks in five years, in 10 years.


Humans evolve slowly, with time to correct for issues in the interaction of humans and their environment.


In contrast, artificial intelligence is evolving at an incredibly fast rate.


And that means that it really matters that we think about this carefully right now -- that we reflect on our own blind spots, our own biases, and think about how that's informing the technology we're creating and discuss what the technology of today will mean for tomorrow.


CEOs and scientists have weighed in on what they think the artificial intelligence technology of the future will be.


Stephen Hawking warns that "Artificial intelligence could end mankind."


Elon Musk warns that it's an existential risk and one of the greatest risks that we face as a civilization.


Bill Gates has made the point, "I don't understand why people aren't more concerned."


But these views -- they're part of the story.


The math, the models, the basic building blocks of artificial intelligence are something that we call access and all work with.


We have open-source tools for machine learning and intelligence that we can contribute to.


And beyond that, we can share our experience.


We can share our experiences with technology and how it concerns us and how it excites us.


We can discuss what we love.


We can communicate with foresight about the aspects of technology that could be more beneficial or could be more problematic over time.


If we all focus on opening up the discussion on AI with foresight towards the future, this will help create a general conversation and awareness about what AI is now, what it can become and all the things that we need to do in order to enable that outcome that best suits us.


We already see and know this in the technology that we use today.


We use smart phones and digital assistants and Roombas.


Are they evil?


Maybe sometimes.


Are they beneficial?


Yes, they're that, too.


And they're not all the same.


And there you already see a light shining on what the future holds.


The future continues on from what we build and create right now.


We set into motion that domino effect that carves out AI's evolutionary path.


In our time right now, we shape the AI of tomorrow.


Technology that immerses us in augmented realities bringing to life past worlds.


Technology that helps people to share their experiences when they have difficulty communicating.


Technology built on understanding the streaming visual worlds used as technology for self-driving cars.


Technology built on understanding images and generating language, evolving into technology that helps people who are visually impaired be better able to access the visual world.


And we also see how technology can lead to problems.


We have technology today that analyzes physical characteristics we're born with -- such as the color of our skin or the look of our face -- in order to determine whether or not we might be criminals or terrorists.


We have technology that crunches through our data, even data relating to our gender or our race, in order to determine whether or not we might get a loan.


All that we see now is a snapshot in the evolution of artificial intelligence.


Because where we are right now, is within a moment of that evolution.


That means that what we do now will affect what happens down the line and in the future.


If we want AI to evolve in a way that helps humans, then we need to define the goals and strategies that enable that path now.


What I'd like to see is something that fits well with humans, with our culture and with the environment.


Technology that aids and assists those of us with neurological conditions or other disabilities in order to make life equally challenging for everyone.


Technology that works regardless of your demographics or the color of your skin.


And so today, what I focus on is the technology for tomorrow and for 10 years from now.


AI can turn out in many different ways.


But in this case, it isn't a self-driving car without any destination.


This is the car that we are driving.


We choose when to speed up and when to slow down.


We choose if we need to make a turn.


We choose what the AI of the future will be.


There's a vast playing field of all the things that artificial intelligence can become.


It will become many things.


And it's up to us now, in order to figure out what we need to put in place to make sure the outcomes of artificial intelligence are the ones that will be better for all of us.


Thank you.

Top British bank HSBC denies "setting up trap" for China's Huawei in US investigations - RT Business News


London-headquartered multinational bank HSBC took to social media to say it was not, as Chinese media claimed, "fabricating evidence" against Huawei, which led to the arrest of the company's chief financial officer in Canada.


In a now-unavailable post on WeChat, the lender said that its actions did not trigger US investigations into the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment, as the scrutiny of Huawei for allegedly violating US sanctions on Iran began well before the bank's involvement in late 2016.


"HSBC does not have any hostility towards Huawei and did not "frame" Huawei," the bank said on Saturday, adding that it would never distort any facts about its clients.


"In response to US DOJ's [US Justice Department] requests for information, HSBC Group simply presented the objective facts.


HSBC did not "fabricate" evidence or "hide" facts."


The post has been blocked on the platform with a note that it "violates regulations" and is not available now.


The statement comes shortly after multiple Chinese media outlets, including state-linked newspapers, accused HSBC of "conspiring" with Washington to set a trap for Huawei.


The company has been at the epicenter of a diplomatic scandal for more than a year and a half since Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in December 2018 in Canada on a warrant from the US.


Meng faces fraud charges for allegedly using a shell company to violate sanctions against Iran and allegedly lying to banks about the link between Huawei and Iranian company Skycom.


According new evidence cited by the Global Times, HSBC was well aware of the Chinese company's relationship with Skycom.


The bank reportedly opted to "collude" with the US government to escape more severe punishment in 2012, when the bank had to admit to money laundering and sanctions violations, including restrictions on Iran.


It was ordered at the time to pay around $1.9 billion in penalties and to prevent any similar misconduct.


"The evidence indicated that HSBC understood this relationship but intentionally sold out its customer's confidential business documents to the US side so that the US government could overlook the British bank's own misconduct and not punish it under the 2012 Deferred Prosecution Agreement," the newspaper said in one of its articles on the matter.


In a veiled warning, the Beijing-controlled newspaper added that the lender, if proven to be guilty of this "collusion," could face "harsh punishment" in China, one of the major markets for HSBC.


It is not the first time the renowned bank has come under fire in recent weeks.


Last month, HSBC was lambasted for supporting the new national security law for Hong Kong, the city where its business started and which accounts for over half of its profits.


The bank faced criticism from both sides - from the West, with US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling the endorsement a "corporate kowtow," and the East, with the Chinese side reportedly saying that its support was "belated."


Angola: Pedalé Hospital Assigned to Health Ministry


Luanda - The President of the Republic, João Lourenço, determined this Friday the transfer of the supervision of the Pedro Maria Tonha Pedalé Hospital, under construction in Luanda, to the sphere of the Ministry of Health.


In a note, the Press Office of the President of the Republic informs that the measure aims to materialize the Government principle of construction and expansion of the network of public hospitals to ensure better medical care and medication to the population.


"In this specific case, the idea is to make available to Angolans a reference hospital, differentiated and equipped with modern technology and high precision in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of high complexity," the document reads.


It stresses that the decision of the Angolan Head of State also takes into account the demographic growth of the country, which has motivated a "huge demand" for quality health services in the most diverse specialties.


This demand, the note continues, justifies with the inclusion in the hospital specialized for the treatment of complex diseases, teaching and research, interventions related to ophthalmology and maternal-infant medicine, areas whose strategy and management deserve to be under the responsibility of the Ministry of Health.


Today I'd like to show you the future of the way we make things.


I believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling, replicating and repairing themselves.


So I'm going to show you what I believe is the current state of manufacturing, and then compare that to some natural systems.


So in the current state of manufacturing, we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [of assembly time], 500,000 to a million parts, fairly complex, new, exciting technologies in steel, concrete, glass.


We have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [of assembly time], 2.5 million parts.


But on the other side, if you look at the natural systems, we have proteins that have two million types, can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds, or DNA with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour.


So there's all of this complexity in our natural systems, but they're extremely efficient, far more efficient than anything we can build, far more complex than anything we can build.


They're far more efficient in terms of energy.


They hardly ever make mistakes.


And they can repair themselves for longevity.


So there's something super interesting about natural systems.


And if we can translate that into our built environment, then there's some exciting potential for the way that we build things.


And I think the key to that is self-assembly.


So if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment, I think there's four key factors.


The first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines.


And we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the DNA of how our buildings work.


Then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up, or reconfigure.


We need some energy that's going to allow that to activate, allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program.


And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want.


So I'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and I at MIT are working on to achieve this self-assembling future.


The first two are the MacroBot and DeciBot.


So these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft., 12 ft. long proteins.


They're embedded with mechanical electrical devices, sensors.


You decode what you want to fold up into, into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120, negative 120, 0, 0, 120, negative 120 -- something like that; so a sequence of angles, or turns, and you send that sequence through the string.


Each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that, checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor.


So these are the brilliant scientists, engineers, designers that worked on this project.


And I think it really brings to light: Is this really scalable?


I mean, thousands of dollars, lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot.


Can we really scale this up? Can we really embed robotics into every part?


The next one questions that and looks at passive nature, or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability.


But it goes a step further, and it tries to have actual computation.


It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing, the digital logic gate, directly into your parts.


So this is a NAND gate.


You have one tetrahedron which is the gate that's going to do your computing, and you have two input tetrahedrons.


One of them is the input from the user, as you're building your bricks.


The other one is from the previous brick that was placed.


And then it gives you an output in 3D space.


So what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do.


It computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do.


And now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down.


So on the left-hand side, [1,1] input equals 0 output, which goes down.


On the right-hand side, [0,0] input is a 1 output, which goes up.


And so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build.


So they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed.


So that means that we can have some form of self-replication.


In this case I call it self-guided replication, because your structure contains the exact blueprints.


If you have errors, you can replace a part.


All the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it.


So you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one.


It's directly embedded; there's no external instructions.


So the last project I'll show is called Biased Chains, and it's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems.


So it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system.


So basically you have a chain of elements.


Each element is completely identical, and they're biased.


So each chain, or each element, wants to turn right or left.


So as you assemble the chain, you're basically programming it.


You're telling each unit if it should turn right or left.


So when you shake the chain, it then folds up into any configuration that you've programmed in -- so in this case, a spiral, or in this case, two cubes next to each other.


So you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional, two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively.


So what does this tell us about the future?


I think that it's telling us that there's new possibilities for self-assembly, replication, repair in our physical structures, our buildings, machines.


There's new programmability in these parts.


And from that you have new possibilities for computing.


We'll have spatial computing.


Imagine if our buildings, our bridges, machines, all of our bricks could actually compute.


That's amazing parallel and distributed computing power, new design possibilities.


So it's exciting potential for this.


So I think these projects I've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future, if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world.


Thank you.

Many believe driving is an activity solely reserved for those who can see.


A blind person driving a vehicle safely and independently was thought to be an impossible task, until now.


Hello, my name is Dennis Hong, and we're bringing freedom and independence to the blind by building a vehicle for the visually impaired.


So before I talk about this car for the blind, let me briefly tell you about another project that I worked on called the DARPA Urban Challenge.


Now this was about building a robotic car that can drive itself.


You press start, nobody touches anything, and it can reach its destination fully autonomously.


So in 2007, our team won half a million dollars by placing third place in this competition.


So about that time, the National Federation of the Blind, or NFB, challenged the research committee about who can develop a car that lets a blind person drive safely and independently.


We decided to give it a try, because we thought, "Hey, how hard could it be?"


We have already an autonomous vehicle.


We just put a blind person in it and we're done, right?


(Laughter) We couldn't have been more wrong.


What NFB wanted was not a vehicle that can drive a blind person around, but a vehicle where a blind person can make active decisions and drive.


So we had to throw everything out the window and start from scratch.


So to test this crazy idea, we developed a small dune buggy prototype vehicle to test the feasibility.


And in the summer of 2009, we invited dozens of blind youth from all over the country and gave them a chance to take it for a spin.


It was an absolutely amazing experience.


But the problem with this car was it was designed to only be driven in a very controlled environment, in a flat, closed-off parking lot -- even the lanes defined by red traffic cones.


So with this success, we decided to take the next big step, to develop a real car that can be driven on real roads.


So how does it work?


Well, it's a rather complex system, but let me try to explain it, maybe simplify it.


So we have three steps.


We have perception, computation and non-visual interfaces.


Now obviously the driver cannot see, so the system needs to perceive the environment and gather information for the driver.


For that, we use an initial measurement unit.


So it measures acceleration, angular acceleration -- like a human ear, inner ear.


We fuse that information with a GPS unit to get an estimate of the location of the car.


We also use two cameras to detect the lanes of the road.


And we also use three laser range finders.


The lasers scan the environment to detect obstacles -- a car approaching from the front, the back and also any obstacles that run into the roads, any obstacles around the vehicle.


So all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer, and the computer can do two things.


One is, first of all, process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lanes of the road, there's the obstacles -- and convey this information to the driver.


The system is also smart enough to figure out the safest way to operate the car.


So we can also generate instructions on how to operate the controls of the vehicle.


But the problem is this: How do we convey this information and instructions to a person who cannot see fast enough and accurate enough so he can drive?


So for this, we developed many different types of non-visual user interface technology.


So starting from a three-dimensional ping sound system, a vibrating vest, a click wheel with voice commands, a leg strip, even a shoe that applies pressure to the foot.


But today we're going to talk about three of these non-visual user interfaces.


Now the first interface is called a DriveGrip.


So these are a pair of gloves, and it has vibrating elements on the knuckle part so you can convey instructions about how to steer -- the direction and the intensity.


Another device is called SpeedStrip.


So this is a chair -- as a matter of fact, it's actually a massage chair.


We gut it out, and we rearrange the vibrating elements in different patterns, and we actuate them to convey information about the speed, and also instructions how to use the gas and the brake pedal.


So over here, you can see how the computer understands the environment, and because you cannot see the vibration, we actually put red LED's on the driver so that you can see what's happening.


This is the sensory data, and that data is transferred to the devices through the computer.


So these two devices, DriveGrip and SpeedStrip, are very effective.


But the problem is these are instructional cue devices.


So this is not really freedom, right?


The computer tells you how to drive -- turn left, turn right, speed up, stop.


We call this the "backseat-driver problem."


So we're moving away from the instructional cue devices, and we're now focusing more on the informational devices.


A good example for this informational non-visual user interface is called AirPix.


So think of it as a monitor for the blind.


So it's a small tablet, has many holes in it, and compressed air comes out, so it can actually draw images.


So even though you are blind, you can put your hand over it, you can see the lanes of the road and obstacles.


Actually, you can also change the frequency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature.


So it's actually a multi-dimensional user interface.


So here you can see the left camera, the right camera from the vehicle and how the computer interprets that and sends that information to the AirPix.


For this, we're showing a simulator, a blind person driving using the AirPix.


This simulator was also very useful for training the blind drivers and also quickly testing different types of ideas for different types of non-visual user interfaces.


So basically that's how it works.


But this vehicle is a prototype vehicle, and it's not going to be on the road until it's proven as safe as, or safer than, today's vehicle.


And I truly believe that this can happen.


But still, will the society, would they accept such a radical idea?


How are we going to handle insurance?


How are we going to issue driver's licenses?


There's many of these different kinds of hurdles besides technology challenges that we need to address before this becomes a reality.


Of course, the main goal of this project is to develop a car for the blind.


But potentially more important than this is the tremendous value of the spin-off technology that can come from this project.


The sensors that are used can see through the dark, the fog and rain.


And together with this new type of interfaces, we can use these technologies and apply them to safer cars for sighted people.


Or for the blind, everyday home appliances -- in the educational setting, in the office setting.


Just imagine, in a classroom a teacher writes on the blackboard and a blind student can see what's written and read using these non-visual interfaces.


This is priceless.


So today, the things I've showed you today, is just the beginning.


Thank you very much.

Algeria: Mahmoud Guemama's Death - Algeria Loses a Patriot, Committed Militant, Says President Tebboune.


Algiers - President of the Republic, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, sent a message of condolences to members of the People's National Assembly (APN), Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, who died Friday, in which he said that Algeria "has lost a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation."


Algeria loses today, by the death of Mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, a patriot and a militant committed to the causes of his people and his nation, a man who has never wavered and whose determination remained intact from the moment he took up arms, alongside his valiant Mujahedeen brothers, until his last breath on this sad day when we can only resign ourselves to God's will," President Tebboune wrote in his message of condolence.


"The late Mahmoud Guemama, peace be upon him, belonged to a unique generation of faithful patriotic militants who sacrificed themselves for their homeland," added President of the Republic.


"The deceased devoted his life to the liberation of Algeria from the torments of abject colonialism, by joining the ranks of the Revolution in the prime of life in 1960 in the Tahart training camp of the historic wilaya VI."


"The late President is known to all for his proven militancy and his commitment to anchoring the image of a prosperous and united Algeria," said President Tebboune.


"In the far south, the late Mahmoud Guemama enjoys great renown as a mediator, intervening to reconcile brothers in the same country whenever the fire of discord is kindled," added the President in his message.


"All these qualities and values earned the late Mahmoud Guemama the respect and trust of the people of Tamanrasset who chose him to represent them in the People's National Assembly (APN) for several terms, during which he was the ambassador and defender of the concerns of the region and the aspirations of its people, and even the representative and spokesman of all Algerians," wrote the President of the Republic.


"All expressions of condolence will not be enough to pay tribute to the mujahed Mahmoud Guemama, peace be upon him.


He is leaving us today at a time when Algeria needs him," said the President.


"I pray to Almighty God to surround the deceased with His Holy Mercy, to welcome him in His vast paradise alongside the shuhadaa and virtuous.


I also pray to God to lend his family and loved ones patience and comfort...there is no strength or power except in God," the President of the Republic concluded.


Coronavirus Travel Update: Which Countries Have Travel Restriction for Bulgarians Upon Entry


The number of countries imposing travel restrictions is growing. As of this week, the Czech Republic wants coronavirus tests for Bulgarian seasonal workers. Denmark allows Bulgarians on its territory only if they have an address registration there, an employment contract or a document certifying a business trip.


As of today, people who have visited Bulgaria and Romania in the last 14 days are subject to mandatory quarantine in Italy. In Finland, entry is only for a "valid reason."


Mandatory home quarantine in Austria, despite a negative PCR test. This is already required for those entering Germany. For the next 14 days, access to southern Romania was denied without good reason. And Greece has tightened measures even more along its land borders.


From Tuesday, those traveling by plane from Bulgaria to Greece will have to present to the Greek border authorities a negative result from a PCR test for coronavirus, performed up to 72 hours before their entry into our southern neighbor, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced.


They added that only passengers who have a certificate for such a test will be allowed in the country. It must be issued in English and contain the three names and numbers of the passenger's passport or identity card. The authorities in our southern neighbor will not accept certificates that do not meet these requirements


"Travelers should be tested in the laboratory by RT-PCR by taking secretions from the mouth or nose. Tests for coronavirus will be recognized if they are performed in national reference laboratories, national health laboratories or private laboratories that are accredited by the relevant national accreditation bodies (not necessarily specifically for COVID-19).


The measure does not apply to Greek citizens, citizens residing in Greece and travelers for significant professional reasons.


The Greek Ministry of Foreign Affairs also announced that on Tuesday, July 28, and Wednesday, July 29, passengers who did not have time to be tested before their trip will be tested by the competent Greek authorities upon arrival in Greece.


The requirement for citizens traveling by plane to Greece to fill in at least 24 hours in advance an electronic Passenger Location Form (PLF) generating a QR code, which they present to the Greek authorities upon entering the country, remains in force. More information is published on travel.gov.gr


At the moment there is no change in the requirements for crossing the land borders between Bulgaria and Greece. "Travelers to Greece across the land border, regardless of their citizenship, must also fill in an electronic passenger localization form (PLF) generating a QR code at least 24 hours before arrival," the Foreign Ministry explained.


The closure of the Ilinden, Kapitan Petko Voyvoda and Makaza checkpoints has increased traffic across the border near Petrich. There are no problems with the transition. There are no queues of trucks. All those waiting go to sea in Greece. Travelers wait about an hour and a half to cross the Tower.


Three of the points on the Bulgarian-Greek border are working. Only "Ilinden - Exohi" and this part of Ivaylovgrad are closed.


Dominic Cummings is held hostage by the SAS... on base tour


PM's chief adviser underwent the experience last week during a tour of the base


The idea of Dominic Cummings being held hostage with rifles pointed at his head might be one for some harassed civil servants to secretly savour.


But the Prime Minister's uncompromising chief adviser underwent just this experience last week during a tour of the SAS headquarters, Stirling Lines.


The Mail on Sunday can reveal that part of his visit on Wednesday involved a trip to the "Killing House" where elite soldiers hone their skills on tackling terrorists.


The guided tour of the Hereford base also included an inspection of the regiment's military hardware and a briefing on recent operations, including efforts to eliminate Islamic State terrorists in Iraq.


High-profile visitors to Stirling Lines are offered an unusual welcome - a turn in the "Killing House," a two-storey building where the SAS practise close-quarter fighting.


Previous guests include Princess Diana, whose hair caught fire thanks to a spark from a grenade thrown during an exercise in 1983.


It is understood that Mr Cummings arrived at the base - named in honour of the regiment's founder, Colonel David Stirling - by helicopter.


He also visited the neighbouring Pontrilas Army Training Area where other top-secret units are based.


The visit was part of his tour of Britain's highly classified UK security installations that has raised eyebrows among politicians and military chiefs.


When news of his plans emerged earlier this month, Tobias Ellwood, a Tory backbencher and chair of the Commons Select Defence Committe, said MPs should be given the same opportunity to question him about defence and security matters as they are afforded for Ministers and civil servants.


Special advisers, who are appointed by politicians, are rarely required to give evidence to select committees.


It is understood that senior SAS officers used Wednesday's event to stress the importance of maintaining the number of personnel in the Royal Marines and the Parachute Regiment.


It has been reported that these units, which provide the majority of Special Forces troops, could shrink or be merged to save money.


"More than half the soldiers in the 250-man SAS were previously Paras while the even smaller Special Boat Service (SBS) couldn't continue without the support of the Royal Marines," said a defence source.


"So Cummings was told that these units must be preserved in their entirety."


Mr Cummings, who has complained that military procurement "has continued to squander billions of pounds," recently attended meetings at the headquarters of MI5 and MI6 and is also planning to visit the SBS's headquarters in Poole, Dorset, along with the Government's top secret laboratories at Porton Down in Wiltshire.


Last night, the Ministry of Defence did not respond to a request for comment.


"Sunday Morning" Matinee: Celebrating Rodgers &amp; Hart


2020 marks the centenary of the Broadway debut of the first professional collaboration by one of musical theater's most legendary duos, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart.


To honor their songwriting legacy, Broadway stars Jelani Alladin ("Frozen," "Hercules") and Christiani Pitts ("King Kong," "A Bronx Tale"), along with dancer Richard Riaz Yoder ("Hello, Dolly!," "Shuffle Along"), present a modern take on the Rodgers &amp; Hart standard "The Lady Is a Tramp," recorded especially for the "Sunday Morning" audience.


Music direction and arrangements by drummer Bryan Carter, who performs alongside bassist Russell Hall.


Firefighters gain ground on Lassen County blazes


Firefighters are gaining ground against two wildfires that have burned more than 30,000 acres in Lassen County, northeast of Sacramento.


The Gold fire, which started south of Adin, is 40% contained as it continues to threaten homes and ranches as well as agriculture, livestock and timber operations, Cal Fire officials said in an update Saturday morning.


After burning for four days, the fire has chewed through 21,000 acres, destroyed seven homes and sent two firefighters to the hospital.


Overnight, firefighters took advantage of milder conditions to build and reinforce control lines.


But gusty winds and low humidity are expected through Saturday.


West of Susanville, a smaller fire known as the Hog fire has destroyed two structures and consumed about 10,000 acres.


The fire settled down overnight as firefighters worked to mop up and strengthen control lines, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.


By Saturday morning, it was 45% contained and had been burning for six days.


In the daytime heat, with temperatures above 90 degrees in the Susanville area, smoldering patches were at risk of flaring up.


While some residents are being allowed to return to their homes, some areas in both fire zones remain under mandatory evacuation orders.


The two firefighters injured in the Gold fire have been released from the hospital.


Scotland-England Union Chain Bridge is 200 years old


A bridge linking Scotland and England has turned 200 years old ahead of a £10m renovation.


The Union Chain Bridge crosses the River Tweed from Fishwick in the Scottish Borders to Horncliffe in Northumberland.


When it opened in 1820, it was the longest wrought iron suspension bridge in the world with a span of 449ft (137m).


It was also the first vehicular bridge of its type in the UK.


The bridge was designed by English Royal Navy officer Capt Samuel Brown.


He patented and produced wrought iron chains after being affected by the loss of Royal Naval ships which had broken free from ropes.


Friends of the Union Chain Bridge and the Institution of Civil Engineers (Ice) Scotland have been marking the crossing's bicentennial.


Robert Hunter, of the friends group, said: "This is truly one of the most historic bridges in the world and a fascinating piece of engineering.


"We had planned a number of celebrations to mark the occasion, but unfortunately they have had to be postponed.


"However, the fact that work is shortly going to begin on the £10m renovation is the best birthday present possible and will ensure generations to come will be able to enjoy the bridge in all its splendour."


Ice Scotland director Hannah Smith described the bridge as an "often-overlooked" part of Scotland's engineering heritage.


She said: "We know it is renowned the world over and it is fantastic that work will shortly commence on its renovation."


North Korea declares state of emergency as Covid-19 case reported


North Korean leader Kim Jong-un convened an emergency politburo meeting after a person suspected of having Covid-19 returned from South Korea after illegally crossing the border this month, state media said on Sunday.


If confirmed, it would be the first case officially acknowledged by North Korean authorities, who have so far said the country has no confirmed cases of coronavirus.


Kim declared a state of emergency and imposed a lockdown on the border city of Kaesong, calling it a "critical situation in which the vicious virus could be said to have entered the country," state news agency KCNA reported.


According to KCNA, a person who defected to South Korea three years ago returned across the fortified border that divides the two Koreas with symptoms that suggested Covid-19.


"An emergency event happened in Kaesong city where a runaway who went to the south three years ago, a person who is suspected to have been infected with the vicious virus returned on 19 July after illegally crossing the demarcation line," KCNA said.


KCNA did not specifically mention whether the individual had been tested, but said an "uncertain result was made from several medical check-ups of the secretion of that person's upper respiratory organ and blood," prompting officials to quarantine the person and investigate anyone he may have been in contact with.


North Korea has received thousands of coronavirus testing kits from Russia and other countries, and imposed strict border closures.


Thousands of people in the secretive nation were quarantined, but restrictions had recently eased.


In recent weeks, North Korea has also stepped up a campaign criticising defectors to South Korea as "human scum" and calling for South Korea to crack down on groups that send propaganda messages and food aid into the North.


Kim ordered an investigation into the military units along the border where the person was suspected of crossing to "administer a severe punishment and take necessary measures."


Threats to Australian democracy are closer to home than China


But a series of recently passed or pending measures in the Commonwealth Parliament give rise to concerns about our own, home-grown authoritarianism.


They include a roll out of facial recognition technology, forcing technology companies to decrypt information held on their customers" computer systems, forcing technology companies to provide access to their customers" cloud-based information without notification to the owner of the information and extending ASIO's compulsory questioning powers.


These measures raise serious questions about the border between citizens and government, but the ASIO Bill is particularly worrying.


Unlike any of the other Five Eyes countries - United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand - in the wake of September 11, ASIO was given power to compulsorily question people for up to seven days in relation to terrorism offences.


While it might be accepted that the extreme violence associated with terrorism offences justifies extraordinary powers - extreme violence at least offers a bright line border around these extraordinary powers.


That certainly cannot be said about the "sweeping and vague" definitions used in this bill to trigger the compulsory questioning power: dealing with information which prejudices Australia's "political, military or economic relations with another country"; or activities in collaboration with a foreign power which are clandestine or deceptive and are "detrimental to Australia's interests."


It is hard to imagine more "sweeping and vague "national security" legislation" than this.


ASIO would be allowed to compulsorily question anyone about these things - not just suspected offenders.


This includes journalists, business people, university academics and staff, lawyers, citizens, residents and visitors.


ASIO would simply have to show the questioning would "substantially contribute to the collection of intelligence" about foreign interference, which seems to be the main target of the bill.


The person could then be questioned for up to 40 hours (not including breaks).


If the person refused to attend, they would be arrested.


Refusal to answer or giving false or misleading answers would carry a maximum five year sentence.


Rules that are fundamental in our legal systems - indeed protected by the constitution in the United States - are overturned by this bill.


People - including people already facing charges - will be compelled to provide evidence that may then be used to prosecute them.


They could have a lawyer present, but the lawyer would be confined to clarifying questions that were ambiguous or unclear.


The new bill transfers the decision to issue a questioning warrant from a judge to the Attorney-General.


As pointed out by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, this "departs from the trend for increased requirements for external authorisation in other Five Eyes jurisdictions."


It also breaches the separation of powers principle that courts scrutinise the actions of executive government.


The new bill also proposes to expand the questioning power to children who are at least 14 years old, but only to those engaged or likely to engage in activities prejudicial to the protection of Australia and people from politically motivated violence.


Even if our intelligence agencies were the best in the world, conferring a power to compulsorily question anyone about information which "prejudices Australia's economic relations with another country," or activities which are "detrimental to Australia's interests" is beyond the pale.


We stand alone.


No other Five Eyes country goes so far, not even for terrorism offences.


Genuinely liberal democracies guard against authoritarian measures.


The conduct of our security agencies in relation to the bugging of the East Timor parliament, the trials of Witness K and Bernard Collaery, the secret trial and imprisonment of a former intelligence officer, the recent search warrants executed on two journalists, and the prospect of charges against one of them in relation to stories on suspected murders by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan show why we should not be lowering our guard.


Bodies of mother, 2 infants found in car submerged in pond


AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Authorities pulled a submerged vehicle from a Georgia pond and found the bodies of a woman and her twin 10-month-old children inside.


The Richmond County Sheriff's Office said crews found the vehicle in Mayor's Pond in Augusta on Friday afternoon, The Augusta Chronicle reported.


Richmond County Coroner Mark Bowen said all three victims were pronounced dead at the scene.


Authorities identified the bodies as 25-year-old Shaquia Philpot and her infant children Caysen and Cassius Williams.


Officials did not release details about how the family ended up in the pond.


A witness, who was fishing in the area, found the car, Bowen said.


The bodies were going to be sent to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for an autopsy.


The case remains under investigation.


"The Persians" Review: Aeschylus's Ancient Portrait of Defeat


There is not much action, barely even a plot, in "The Persians." People just mill about, talking (admittedly rather intensely) about events (admittedly of the tragic kind) that happened far away.


Yet this National Theater of Greece production unleashes gale-force sound and fury. At its peak, the show hits like a blow to the solar plexus, taking your breath away - the impact is only slightly dulled by watching online.


First produced in 472 B.C., Aeschylus's "The Persians" is considered the oldest surviving Greek play. This Dimitris Lignadis staging was broadcast live on Saturday from the ancient amphitheater of Epidaurus; in the spirit of the theater, no recording exists online. The venue was originally conceived as part of the city's asclepeion (a healing center) because the Greeks considered the balance between body and soul essential to good health. Let's all wistfully ponder that philosophy.


The show deals with the aftermath of Salamis, a naval battle in which the outnumbered Greeks routed the mighty Persian army 2,500 years ago. At a time when our horizons are closing in, it is downright vertigo-inducing to virtually join a live audience in watching (subtitled) live actors all the way in Greece as they perform a millenniums-old play.


Aeschylus himself had fought at Salamis, but his play has a twist: This veteran of the winning side set his story among the defeated, casting a fairly sympathetic eye on his recent enemies" distress.


A chorus of Persian men, wearing long, tan-colored skirts and white button-down shirts, opens the proceedings. They are in their capital city anxiously waiting for news of their king, Xerxes, who is off duking it out with Athens.


Enter Xerxes's widowed mother, Queen Atossa (Lydia Koniordou), in a rather large black gown that appears to wear her, rather than the reverse; she is a human in an exoskeleton of fabric, both vulnerable and formidable. Koniordou, who is among Greece's greatest stage actresses, knows the role inside out - she directed and starred in an earlier National Theater of Greece production of "The Persians" that played New York City Center in 2006 - and she anchors the proceedings without seemingly doing much at all. For the most part, she stands in the middle of the circular stage, effortlessly projecting smoldering fury and agonizing sorrow as the scope of the disaster that befell the home troops is revealed.


The apprehension everybody was feeling is confirmed, in harrowing details, by a messenger (Argyris Pandazaras) returning from the front. In an absolutely incredible scene, he recounts the battle, whipping himself into a frenzy as the chorus members dance around him and Giorgos Poulios's drone-like score swells to what must have been a deafening level.


Later they are joined by Atossa's dead husband (Nikos Karathanos), summoned from the underworld, and Xerxes (Argyris Xafis), who has somehow escaped alive from the wreckage. Pieces of string on his tunic mark blood (Eva Nathena's exquisite costumes always contribute to the storytelling). The characters lament the lost lives and devastation together, in an act of communal mourning.


Quite a bit of the classical theater we see in the United States attempts to make it more accessible in one way or another. Often this is done with relatively naturalistic line readings, in an effort to make the text less foreign, easier to digest. But Lignadis and his troupe fully embrace declamation, which may sound a little forced to modern ears but highlights the text's rhythmic power. While technically they do not sing, for example, the four lead actors essentially deliver arias, achieving an incantatory power that feels otherworldly.


We never forget, though, that the play is rooted in emotions that are all too human.


Egypt begins registering data of voters abroad for senate elections


The National Election Authority (NEA) on Saturday began registering the data of voters aboard to begin casting their votes in the senate elections to be held on August 9 and 10, according to the NEA's official website.


Voters must register their data and the diplomatic mission affiliated to their residence abroad on the NEA's website from July 25 until July 31.


The NEA also published a video explaining the steps voters can take to cast their vote remotely via email, as part of precautions against the coronavirus pandemic.


The legal period of senate candidate electoral propaganda runs from July 26 until August 8, the NEA said.


Minister of Emigration and Egyptian Expatriates Affairs Nabila Makram called on Egyptian voters abroad to participate in the election as their constitutional right.


Egypt's House of Representatives on June 17 approved a law establishing a senate, which will function as an upper house of parliament.


The law passed with a two-thirds majority, with the objection of four MPs.


The Senate will consist of 300 members, 100 of whom are elected by a closed list system, 100 elected by an individual system, and 100 members appointed by the President of the Republic.


The term of membership in the Senate will be five years, starting from the date of its first meeting. The new assembly is to be elected during the sixty days preceding the end of its term.

Israel coronavirus cases top 60,000 as infections jump


JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The number of people to test positive for coronavirus in Israel topped 60,000 on Saturday as the government struggles to contain a resurgence in infection rates.


The latest daily tally showed 1,770 new infections, bringing the total number of cases to 60,496, the country's health ministry reported.


With a population of nine million, Israel has reported a total of 455 fatalities from the pandemic.


Israel was one of the first countries to impose a nationwide lockdown and initially was successful in clamping down on the outbreak.


Daily cases that numbered in the hundreds dropped to low double digits.


Concerned about the economic toll, the government eased those restrictions - too quickly, some officials have since acknowledged - and infection rates resurged.


Renewed sporadic closures of various sectors of the economy have deepened public vexation, sparking daily demonstrations.


Be wary of gardening gimmicks that look too good


It might be an embarrassing thing for a plant scientist to admit, but I am a total sucker for a garden gimmick.


I like to think it's because I am open-minded or maybe just irrationally optimistic, particularly as many things in the plant world are often extremely counterintuitive.


But I am not ashamed to say I have fallen for dozens of them over a lifetime in horticulture.


While I firmly believe in the value of trying things out for yourself, if you don't fancy learning the hard way, here are some of the most common garden gimmicks I have come across.


First up, and probably the worst offender, grafted tomato-potato plants.


Hailed as a revolutionary breakthrough, grafting tomato plants on to potato roots is, in fact, an old-school botanical curiosity, dating back to at least the 1920s.


As they are both from the same family and have broadly similar internal "plumbing," you can indeed create such surgically enhanced marvels.


But here's the problem: creating resource-intensive structures like fruits and roots takes up a lot of metabolic energy, and if plants are attempting to do both their limited energies inevitably become split.


That means the yields of these grafted plants are terrible and nothing like what you see in the marketing pictures.


Then there is the fact that the crops mature at different rates, so to harvest the spuds you have to kill the plants before the tomatoes have ripened.


On the subject of marketing imagery, there's a lot of dodgy dealing here, too.


I've seen roses Photoshopped sky blue and fruit trees with a physiologically impossible amount of fruit on their branches in some major catalogues.


I've even seen photos "borrowed" from my Instagram account and used by shopping networks as images of their trial grounds.


Sadly the work of a small minority of cavalier companies mean you have to view advertising images, particularly online, with a very sceptical eye.


If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.


Speaking of which, the colour blue is relatively rare in the botanical world, so if you see a dazzling new heather, orchid or cactus, shining out in the most intense "disinfectant" shade of blue, it's almost certainly been sprayed or dyed.


Which would be fine, so long as vendors made this clear, but they rarely ever do.


Blue moth orchids will revert back to their original white, but sprayed cacti and heathers, coated in a light-suppressing layer of dye, are unlikely to survive for long.


Finally, I have to flag up bonsai kits or, even worse, bonsai seeds, that promise miniature trees will sprout from their packets.


Bonsai is not a species of plant.


It's a training technique used to give the illusion of ancient trees on distant mountaintops.


They are almost always started from mature shrubs that are hacked back and new growth wired in place.


I know I'll keep falling for gimmicks, it's part of the fun of experimentation.


But side-step these ones and you may find one that actually has a chance of living up to its promise.


Spain quarantine: Do you need to quarantine in Spain?


No - but if you return from Spain after midnight tonight, you will have to self isolate at home for 14 days.


British Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said: "The decision to exempt Spain earlier this week, was taken when the data showed there was an improvement in the spread of the virus.


But clearly the latest data has given us cause for concern to overturn that decision.


"We appreciate that this will be disappointing. However, we have always been clear we are closely monitoring the pandemic situation in all countries and that we may require to remove a country from the list of places exempt from quarantine requirements should the virus show a resurgence."


"It is still active and it is still deadly. Suppressing the virus, preventing it from being transmitted and protecting public health is our priority."


No rules around UK travellers arriving in Spain have been announced, however if you are travelling to Spain you should check for local regulations in your area.


Spain's deputy emergency health director Maria Jose Sierra said:


"We have important outbreaks. It could be a second wave. We'll have to see what happens in the next few weeks."


Pakistan's Imam-Ul-Haq Declared Fit To Bat After Warm-Up Injury


Pakistan and England will be facing each other in three Tests and as many T20Is.


Pakistan batsman Imam-ul-Haq has been declared fit to bat by the team's doctor after he was hit on his left hand while batting in an intra-squad warm-up match at Derby.


"The left-handed batsman took part in warm-up session prior to the start of the second day's play," Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) informed in a statement.


PCB Whites' Imam was hit on his left hand while batting against PCB Greens' Naseem Shah on day one of the match.


Imam was forced to retire hurt on Friday evening after being struck on the left hand by a ball from Shah, but was able to take part in a warm-up session in the morning and will resume his innings on the third day.


Over 30 Employees Test Coronavirus Positive At Single Bank Branch In Tamil Nadu


At least 38 employees of a national bank's main branch in Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, have tested positive for coronavirus, officials from the bank and the local civic body have said.


According to the officials, the customers who visited the bank have also been advised to voluntarily appear for coronavirus tests.


Earlier, a senior official of the branch who was suffering from other complications, had died of COVID-19.


The positive cases came to light after a mass medical screening camp was held at the bank recently, the officials said.


Senior bank officials said the disinfection process had been completed and the bank might resume operations from tomorrow.


Corporation health officials are in touch with the customers who visited the bank.


Tamil Nadu, with the highest virus cases in the country after Maharashtra, has reported an overall 2,06,737 positive cases of the virus as of Saturday.


India's PM to attend temple groundbreaking at disputed site


NEW DELHI (AP) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend a groundbreaking ceremony next month for a Hindu temple on a disputed site in northern India where a 16th century mosque was torn down by Hindu hard-liners in 1992, according to the trust overseeing the temple construction.


The ceremony is set for Aug. 5, a date organizers said was astrologically auspicious for Hindus but that also marks a year since the Indian Parliament revoked the semi-autonomous status of its only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir.


The symbolism was impossible to miss for both supporters and opponents of Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, whose manifesto had for decades included pledges to strip restive Kashmir's autonomy and to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram where the Mughal-era mosque once stood, a site in the city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh state that devotees believe to be Ram's birthplace.


Because the coronavirus is still rampaging across India, which has reported the world's third-highest caseload, the ceremony will be broadcast live on state television and the number of participants and spectators will be limited, according to Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or the World Hindu Organization, a Hindu nationalist group allied with the BJP.


The temple will serve as "an enduring and immortal beaming center of social harmony, national unity and integration and awakening of the feeling of Hindutva," or Hindu way of life, the organization's spokesperson Vinod Bansal said in a news release Saturday.


A century-long dispute over the site was resolved last year following the BJP's landslide election victory.


In November, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the temple trust, saying that Muslim petitions would be given five acres at an alternative site.


Hindus hard-liners have long contended that Mughal Muslim invaders built a mosque on top of a preexisting temple in the ancient city of Ayodya.


A December 1992 riot following the destruction of the mosque sparked communal violence in which about 2,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims.


Meanwhile, the trial in the demolition court case continues to be heard in a special court.


An architect from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Modi's home state, has proposed a towering sandstone structure 161 feet (49 meters) high with five domes.


Yogi Adityanath, Uttar Pradesh's chief minister and a Hindu monk, requested that Ayodhya hold a special cleaning and purification ceremony and for all of the city's temples to light oil lamps ahead of Modi's visit, the Press Trust of India news agency reported.


Adityanath said the occasion marked the end of a "500-year struggle," PTI reported.
