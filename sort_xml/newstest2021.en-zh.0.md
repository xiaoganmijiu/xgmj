Dominic Raab: Government can't make apologies for Spain quarantine decision


Dominic Raab has defended the Government's decision to re-introduce quarantine measures on Spain at short notice.


Ministers announced on Saturday that holidaymakers who had not returned from Spain and its islands by midnight would be forced to self-isolate for 14 days.


The country had been on a list of "travel corridor" nations deemed safe to visit by Downing Street, but a recent surge in coronavirus cases has sparked fears of a second wave of the disease.


On Sunday, the Foreign Secretary defended the sudden reimposition of restrictions as a "real-time response" to a worrying spike in infections reported in the region.


He said the situation was then assessed yesterday afternoon "and we took the decision as swiftly as we could."


"We can't make apologies for doing so," he added.


"We must be able to take swift, decisive action, particularly in relation to localised, or internationally in relation to Spain or a particular country, where we see we must take action."


"Otherwise, we risk re-infection into the UK, potentially a second wave here and then another lockdown."


Transport secretary among Spain holidaymakers forced to quarantine


The decision was made after Spain recorded more than 900 new daily Covid-19 cases for two days running.


The Foreign Secretary acknowledged that many tourists had been left with no time to cancel or alter their plans.


"I understand it is disruptive for those going through this who are in Spain or have been considering going but we must be able to take swift, decisive action to protect the UK," he said.


"We've made such progress in getting the virus down and preventing the virus re-taking hold in the UK."


Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth condemned the Government for its "frankly shambolic" handling of the measure.


He said Downing Street's sudden decision had left holidaymakers "confused and distressed."


The Labour MP told Sophy Ridge: "I understand why they've made the decision but, of course, the way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic.


"There are holidaymakers in Spain at the moment confused and distressed, there are people about to go on holiday to Spain and the islands like Tenerife who are confused, and they don't know whether their employers will allow them to take two weeks" quarantine.


"The Government is just saying, "we hope that employers co-operate.""


"The way in which this decision has been made in the last 24 hours is frankly shambolic."


What does Spain being on quarantine list mean for holidaymakers?


He urged ministers to offer "clarity" on whether those who are asked to quarantine will receive financial support if their employers refuse to pay them during the quarantine period.


He added that clear information was also needed "for those holidaymakers who are currently in Spain who have properly saved up all year for their family holiday who are confused and distressed."


"The way in which this decision has been communicated is obviously causing anxiety," he stressed.


Mr Raab said no worker following the new guidance should be penalised by employers, including by being put onto sick pay.


He said: "We are changing the rules - the law is changed in relation to holidaymakers and travellers - and of course we expect employers to show those employees who will have to quarantine because of the law the flexibility they need.


"If someone is following the law in relation to quarantine and self-isolating the way they should, they can't have penalties taken against them."


US "failures" are holding back search for coronavirus drugs


The global effort to produce useful anti-Covid medicines is being hampered by the US because researchers are testing drugs in "an arbitrary, willy-nilly way," the expert leading the UK's programme has warned.


Britain's Recovery Trial programme, which has involved 12,000 patients at several hundred British hospitals, has already pinpointed one promising new drug to tackle the disease and also highlighted two others - previously thought to be potential life-savers - as being useless.


But the failure of the US medical system to match this output has meant that other promising treatments that could have been cleared for widespread use have still to be evaluated.


In particular, convalescent plasma (blood plasma that is taken from Covid-19 patients and which contains antibodies that could protect others against the disease) has still to be properly tested on a large-scale randomised trial.


"Tens of thousands of people have already been given convalescent plasma in the US but these treatments were not randomised," said Professor Martin Landray, one of the founders of the Recovery programme.


"They just give individuals convalescent plasma in the hope it will work. Vast quantities have been given and they still have no idea whether it helps or harms or has no impact," added Landray, an expert in the setting up of large-scale drug trials.


The US is failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine


Randomised drug trials are the gold standard for pinpointing useful medicines.


They remove unconscious biases that might cloud clinicians' judgments.


Thousands of people are given a drug and thousands of others are given a placebo.


No one knows which they have been given.


Then results are compared and the efficacy of the treatment revealed.


In this way, Recovery was able to demonstrate that the steroid dexamethasone reduced deaths by a third in Covid-19 patients on ventilators.


It also showed that the much-hyped drug hydroxychloroquine - as well as the combined therapy of the drugs lopinavir and ritonavir - had no effect in saving patients' lives.


Crucially these trials needed very large numbers of patients and no single hospital has enough for such research.


Britain has had one key advantage - a centralised National Health Service.


By contrast, the US health service is fragmented and its only success in pointing a possible treatment has been highlighting the usefulness of the highly expensive drug remdesivir for speeding recovery of some Covid-19 patients.


"There are lots and lots of small drugs trials involving a few dozen or a few hundred patients going on in the US but nothing of any substance," added Landray.


"They are failing to do large, randomised trials and that ends up providing bad medicine. It makes the practice of medicine poorer and the outcomes for patients poorer."


Landray said this failure was particularly exasperating when it came to the use of convalescent plasma, which many doctors believe could have a key role to play in treating seriously ill Covid-19 patients.


"If you look at the US, huge quantities of this treatment have been used on an arbitrary willy-nilly basis. The UK excels beyond measure compared with what's going on there," he added.


Professor Peter Horby, an expert on infectious diseases and the other founder of the Recovery programme, said:


"There have been reports of 20,000 patients getting convalescent plasma in a cohort but none of those patients were randomised. If they had put these patients into randomised trials, we would now have a clear answer about the effectiveness of convalescent plasma."


Horby added that UK Recovery has now launched a randomised trial of convalescent plasma but does not expect results to be ready until later this year.


Salmonella outbreak sickens 212 people in 23 states


July 25 (UPI) -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating an outbreak of salmonella that has sickened 212 people in 23 states.


In a Friday press release the CDC reported that 87 people had become ill since its last update on the outbreak Tuesday.


The agency said people began showing symptoms linked to a strain of salmonella, which can take two to four weeks to manifest symptoms, between June 19 and July 11.


Thirty-one people have been hospitalized since the outbreak began, but no fatalities have been reported.


According to the CDC, a specific source for the salmonella strain has not been identified.


It has not issued any advisement against eating or consuming particular foods, nor named retailers that might be selling contaminated products.


Oregon has had the most cases of salmonella, with 51 infections, with Utah following close behind with 40 reported cases.


Salmonella is a bacterial, foodborne illness that causes 1.35 million infections, 26,500 hospitalizations, and 420 deaths each year, according to the CDC.


The most common symptoms of salmonella infection are diarrhea, fever, and stomach cramps, which can begin between six hours and six days after exposure.


The illness usually lasts four to seven days, and most people recover without treatment, but some cases require hospitalization.


Couple MACED at California dog park for not wearing face masks while having lunch (VIDEO) - RT USA News


There's mask-shaming and then there's full on assault.


A California couple having lunch with their puppy at a dog park experienced the second, when an irate woman pepper-sprayed them for refusing to mask up... while eating.


Ash O'Brien and husband Jarett Kelley say they were grabbing a bite to eat at Dusty Rhodes dog park in San Diego on Thursday, with their three-month-old pug in tow.


The pair had their masks off to eat, when a "random old lady" approached, calling them "idiots" for not masking up, even though "you can't wear a mask and eat at the same time."


O'Brien told the woman to leave the park and stop harassing her, at which point the woman unleashed a can of mace at the couple.


Video footage captured by a bystander begins with Kelley wrestling the spray can from the woman, and getting a dose of mace into the face for his troubles.


O'Brien can be heard crying in the background as the attacker walks away with her dogs.


O'Brien shared the video on Facebook and told ABC 10 that she wants to see the woman "go to jail."


Face masks are mandatory across the state of California, even in fresh air.


These masks can only be removed at a select few times, including when eating or drinking.


However, nowhere in the state's coronavirus guidelines does it say that bystanders may use non-lethal weapons to enforce this policy.


Even in the current era of "mask-shaming," that's still a crime carrying a penalty of a fine of $1,000 or up to three years in a state prison.


Flat, Free Education For Indore Egg Seller Paras Raykar Whose Cart Was Overturned Allegedly Over Rs. 100 Bribe


Paras Raykar's cart carrying eggs was allegedly overturned Thursday by the civic officials in Indore.


Two days after the story of a 13-year-old egg seller's cart being overturned by civic officials went viral on social media, the Indore-based boy has found overwhelming support from people across the country, helping them recover from the losses and manage to start their business again.


The boy's family also claimed that politicians including Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal have reached out to them and offered support.


The boy's family also received a flat and offer to take care of the educational expenses of the children in the family.


Paras Raykar's cart carrying eggs was allegedly overturned Thursday by the civic officials in Indore, where the administration has implemented the "left-right" rule for the staggered opening of shops amid the coronavirus pandemic.


A video in which the boy alleged that the officials had warned him in the morning to remove his cart or pay Rs 100 as bribe had gone viral on social media.


When he refused, the officials tipped his cart over, destroying all the eggs, the boy alleged.


The boy had also claimed that his daily sale has been down due to the pandemic and the loss of his stock will put additional financial burden on him, in the video.


Since Thursday, the boy's family has been overwhelmed with support from people across the country, many of them offering help in both cash and kind.


The family has also received help from locals.


While former chief minister Digvijaya Singh has offered financial support and help to get the children admitted in a college, BJP MLA from Indore, Ramesh Mendola, has assured to provide a house under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana to the child.


Indore Press Club has also provided ration and money to the boy.


Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's office and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has also offered help.


"We are overwhelmed by the support from people across the country.


(BJP MLA) Ramesh Mendola has assured a flat under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.


He has also provided a cycle and Rs 2,500.


Digvijaya Singh has provided Rs 10,000 and assurance to look after the education of the two children.


Rahul Gandhi's office has also called and offered support.


A woman from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal called and offered help.


Jyothiraditya Scindia has also offered support," Paras's grandfather said.


Recently, we've seen the effects of cyber attacks on the business world.


Data breaches at companies like JP Morgan, Yahoo, Home Depot and Target have caused losses of hundreds of millions and in some cases, billions of dollars.


It wouldn't take many large attacks to ravage the world economy.


And the public sector has not been immune, either.


In 2012 to 2014, there was a significant data breach at the US Office of Personnel Management.


Security clearance and fingerprint data was compromised, affecting 22 million employees.


And you may have heard of the attempt by state-sponsored hackers to use stolen data to influence election outcomes in a number of countries.


Two recent examples are the compromise of a large amount of data from the Bundestag, the national Parliament of Germany, and the theft of emails from the US Democratic National Committee.


The cyber threat is now affecting our democratic processes.


And it's likely to get worse.


As computer technology is becoming more powerful, the systems we use to protect our data are becoming more vulnerable.


Adding to the concern is a new type of computing technology, called quantum computing, which leverages microscopic properties of nature to deliver unimaginable increases in computational power.


It's so powerful that it will crack many of the encryption systems that we use today.


So is the situation hopeless?


Should we start packing our digital survival gear and prepare for an upcoming data apocalypse?


I would say, not yet.


Quantum computing is still in the labs, and it will take a few years until it's put to practical applications.


More important, there have been major breakthroughs in the field of encryption.


For me, this is a particularly exciting time in the history of secure communications.


About 15 years ago, when I learned of our new-found ability to create quantum effects that don't exist in nature, I was excited.


The idea of applying the fundamental laws of physics to make encryption stronger really intrigued me.


Today, a select groups of companies and labs around the world, including mine, are maturing this technology for practical applications.


That's right.


We are now preparing to fight quantum with quantum.


So how does this all work?


Well, first, let's take a quick tour of the world of encryption.


For that, you'll need a briefcase, some important documents that you want to send your friend, James Bond, and a lock to keep it all safe.


Because the documents are top secret, we're going to use an advanced briefcase.


It has a special combination lock which, when closed, converts all the text in the documents to random numbers.


So you put your documents inside, close the lock -- at which point in time the documents get converted to random numbers -- and you send the briefcase to James.


While it's on its way, you call him to give him the code.


When he gets the briefcase, he enters the code, the documents get unscrambled, and voilà, you've just sent an encoded message to James Bond.


(Laughter) A fun example, but it does illustrate three things important for encryption.


The code -- we call this an encryption key.


You can think of it as a password.


The call to James to give him the code for the combination lock.


We call this key exchange.


This is how you ensure you get the encryption key securely to the right place.


And the lock, which encodes and decodes the document.


We call this an encryption algorithm.


Using the key, it encodes the text in the documents to random numbers.


A good algorithm will encode in such a way that without the key it's very difficult to unscramble.


What makes encryption so important is that if someone were to capture the briefcase and cut it open without the encryption key and the encryption algorithm, they wouldn't be able to read the documents.


They would look like nothing more than a bunch of random numbers.


Most security systems rely on a secure method for key exchange to communicate the encryption key to the right place.


However, rapid increases in computational power are putting at risk a number of the key exchange methods we have today.


Consider one of the very widely used systems today -- RSA.


When it was invented, in 1977, it was estimated that it would take 40 quadrillion years to break a 426-bit RSA key.


In 1994, just 17 years later, the code was broken.


As computers have become more and more powerful, we've had to use larger and larger codes.


Today we routinely use 2048 or 4096 bits.


As you can see, code makers and breakers are engaged in an ongoing battle to outwit each other.


And when quantum computers arrive in the next 10 to 15 years, they will even more rapidly crack the complex mathematics that underlies many of our encryption systems today.


Indeed, the quantum computer is likely to turn our present security castle into a mere house of cards.


We have to find a way to defend our castle.


There's been a growing body of research in recent years looking at using quantum effects to make encryption stronger.


And there have been some exciting breakthroughs.


Remember those three things important for encryption -- high-quality keys, secure key exchange and a strong algorithm?


Well, advances in science and engineering are putting two of those three elements at risk.


First of all, those keys.


Random numbers are the foundational building blocks of encryption keys.


But today, they're not truly random.


Currently, we construct encryption keys from sequences of random numbers generated from software, so-called pseudo-random numbers.


Numbers generated by a program or a mathematical recipe will have some, perhaps subtle, pattern to them.


The less random the numbers are, or in scientific terms, the less entropy they contain, the easier they are to predict.


Recently, several casinos have been victims of a creative attack.


The output of slot machines was recorded over a period of time and then analyzed.


This allowed the cyber criminals to reverse engineer the pseudo-random number generator behind the spinning wheels.


And allowed them, with high accuracy, to predict the spins of the wheels, enabling them to make big financial gains.


Similar risks apply to encryption keys.


So having a true random number generator is essential for secure encryption.


For years, researchers have been looking at building true random number generators.


But most designs to date are either not random enough, fast enough or aren't easily repeatable.


But the quantum world is truly random.


So it makes sense to take advantage of this intrinsic randomness.


Devices that can measure quantum effects can produce an endless stream of random numbers at high speed.


Foiling all those would-be casino criminals.


A select group of universities and companies around the world are focused on building true random number generators.


At my company, our quantum random number generator started life on a two meter by one meter optic table.


We were then able to reduce it to a server-size box.


Today, it's miniaturized into a PCI card that plugs into a standard computer.


This is the world's fastest true random number generator.


It measures quantum effects to produce a billion random numbers per second.


And it's in use today to improve security at cloud providers, banks and government agencies around the world.


(Applause) But even with a true random number generator, we've still got the second big cyber threat: the problem of secure key exchange.


Current key exchange techniques will not stand up to a quantum computer.


The quantum solution to this problem is called quantum key distribution or QKD, which leverages a fundamental, counterintuitive characteristic of quantum mechanics.


The very act of looking at a quantum particle changes it.


Let me give you an example of how this works.


Consider again exchanging the code for the lock with James Bond.


Except this time, instead of a call to give James the code, we're going to use quantum effects on a laser to carry the code and send it over standard optic fiber to James.


We assume that Dr. No is trying to hack the exchange.


Luckily, Dr. No's attempt to intercept the quantum keys while in transit will leave fingerprints that James and you can detect.


This allows those intercepted keys to be discarded.


The keys which are then retained can be used to provide very strong data protection.


And because the security is based on the fundamental laws of physics, a quantum computer, or indeed any future supercomputer will not be able to break it.


My team and I are collaborating with leading universities and the defense sector to mature this exciting technology into the next generation of security products.


The internet of things is heralding a hyperconnected era with 25 to 30 billion connected devices forecast by 2020.


For the correct functioning of our society in an IoT world, trust in the systems that support these connected devices is vital.


We're betting that quantum technologies will be essential in providing this trust, enabling us to fully benefit from the amazing innovations that are going to so enrich our lives.


Thank you.


(Applause)


Home Secretary Priti Patel demands explanation from Twitter and Instagram over 'abhorrent' Wiley tweets


Priti Patel has demanded an explanation from Twitter and Instagram over the length of time it took to remove "abhorrent" posts made by Wiley.


Police are currently investigating a series of antisemitic comments posted on the Grime artist's social media accounts.


The Home Secretary tweeted on Sunday: "The antisemitic posts from Wiley are abhorrent.


"They should not have been able to remain on Twitter and Instagram for so long and I have asked them for a full explanation.


"Social media companies must act much faster to remove such appalling hatred from their platforms."


Twitter was accused of "ignoring antisemitism" as Wiley's tweets were still visible 12 hours after they were first posted.


A number of tweets have since been removed and the 41-year-old has been issued a seven-day ban by the site.


Twitter previously said Wiley's account had been temporarily locked "for violating our hateful conduct policy," while Facebook said there was "no place for hate speech on Instagram."


The Metropolitan Police said on Saturday: "The Met takes all reports of antisemitism extremely seriously. The relevant material is being assessed."


Meanwhile, Wiley's management company, A-List Management, "cut all ties" with the star.


The artist's now former manager, John Woolf, who is Jewish, wrote on Twitter: "Following Wiley's antisemitic tweets today we at @A_ListMGMT have cut all ties with him. There is no place in society for antisemitism."


He had earlier said he did not support or condone what Wiley posted but that he would speak to him privately and "help educate him."


However, in a video on Instagram, Wiley appeared to say it was him who had cut ties with his management.


Other MPs criticised Twitter for allowing the tweets to remain visible.


Labour MP Jess Phillips said on Saturday: "Just seen all the Wiley stuff. Why on earth have @Twitter left up such blatant antisemitism and hatred? It hits all the dangerous beats, Jews get things you don't get, they are in control, they think their better... This is dangerous stuff. Surely it should come down."


Fellow MP Neil Coyle added: "His management appear able to act quicker than @Twitter emphasising, once again, that legislation (including the Online Harms Bill) should ensure social media platforms are not used to spread hate."


John Mann, the government's independent adviser on antisemitism, said the tweets "demonstrated precisely why the law needs changing to hold them to reasonable account."


Meanwhile, the Campaign Against Antisemitism asked police to investigate Wiley's content and called on his social media accounts to be shut down "to prevent further outpouring of anti-Jewish venom."


Wiley, known as the Godfather of Grime and whose real name is Richard Cowie, received an MBE for services to music in 2018.


Kudlow says next coronavirus stimulus bill will include more checks, extend moratorium on evictions


White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow promised on Sunday that the federal government will extend the moratorium on evictions and send out another round of checks as part of the next coronavirus stimulus package.


Kudlow's comments come after a week where the White House's hoped for payroll tax cuts were shot down by Congress.


"There's a $1,200 check coming. That is going to be part of the new package. I would have preferred a payroll tax cut, on top of that check," Kudlow said on CNN's "State of the Union.


"But, be that as it may, politically, it doesn't work."


While no deal has been officially announced, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have been on Capitol Hill recently to discuss the details of a new relief package with congressional leaders.


On ending the additional $600 in unemployment benefits the federal government was supplying, Kudlow argued that the extra money was hurting small businesses from hiring workers.


"We have had a flood of inquiries and phone calls and complaints that small stores and businesses, restaurants can't hire people back," he said.


"They went too far. Maybe last March, it was necessary for that, but, really, there are consequences of people not returning to work."


Mnuchin earlier in the day on "Fox News Sunday" said it a little more bluntly: "I think workers and Americans understand the concept that you shouldn't be paid more to stay home than to work."


Mnuchin said the new bill will provide additional unemployment benefits, but noted that it will be less than the payments issued under the CARES Act.


He said some workers were collecting more than they earned on the job.


As a result, when businesses were reopening some employees did not have an incentive to return to work.


The secretary said the Trump administration and Senate Republicans are on the same page with a $1 trillion package, but noted that in the interest of passing a bill quickly, issues that are more difficult to negotiate with Democrats could be held off for another bill.


Queen and Adam Lambert: Brian May celebrates Roger Taylor's birthday


The Queen legend shares his birthday today with The Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, who is now 77-years-old.


Brian May celebrated his 73rd birthday last weekend on July 19 and thanked fans for the birthday wishes.


The rock star wrote next to a snap of him and his wife Anita Dobson: "Birthday dinner for me - created by Anita - we dressed up to stay home !"


Egypt court refers man who murdered three children to psychiatric evaluation


The South Minya Prosecution's Attorney General Tamer Motea on Sunday sentenced a farmer to four days imprisonment pending investigations into why he murdered his three children while also referring him to a psychiatric committee.


On July 24, 56-year-old Mohamed Ali threw his children Khadiga, four, Mena, eight, and Omar, six, in front of a moving train at the Mallawi Railway Station.


Ali was found to be babbling incoherently during investigations, leading to suspicion he was suffering a mental breakdown.


His wife denied she had suffered any problems with him and attributed his behavior to psychological issues.


Villagers from Massart Mallawi refrained from speaking about the incident, offering only their condolences to the children's family.


Roughly 93 percent of Egyptian children aged one to 14 years old suffer from violence, said Khalid Darwish, advisor to the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood back in October.


Prosecution is one of the most important pillars in eliminating child abuse, he added, stressing the importance of cooperation between the council and Public Prosecution in this regard.


According to a study prepared by the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood, children are subjected to violence in places that are supposed to be safe, such as home, school or clubs, and exposed to violence from people who are supposed to care for them, such as parents or teachers.


AP blasts White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany for "political" briefings - but reporters keep asking political questions - RT USA News


The Associated Press has accused White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany of worrying the media by making her briefings political rather than informational -- apparently forgetting that reporters choose the questions.


An article Saturday by the AP, the largest US news agency, said White House press briefings may be a "broken tradition," as McEnany has made them "a streamlined, full-throated advertisement for a president facing re-election, a venue for attacks on the media and a forum relatively light on information" about what the government is doing.


The last of those assertions is indisputable, as hardly any new information is revealed at the briefings.


What the AP failed to mention is that hardly any new information is actually sought at the briefings.


Reporters frequently use White House pressers to draw attention to themselves, an art form perfected by CNN's Jim Acosta.


They go beyond the typical adversarial media-administration relationship, repeating each other in asking gotcha questions aimed only at impugning President Donald Trump.


In some cases, they make themselves the news, such as when CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang responded to an "ask China" retort from Trump by making a not-so-subtle hint at racism: "Sir, why are you saying that to me specifically?"


A July 6 briefing offered a prime example of the disconnect over how the briefings have ceased to be a source of meaningful information for Americans.


Trump tweeted that morning that NASCAR's television ratings had been hurt by a false allegation of a hate crime against driver Bubba Wallace and by its decision to ban display of the Confederate flag at its events.


Predictably, most of the questions were about the tweet as reporter after reporter asked McEnany questions designed to prompt her to say that Trump supports the Confederate flag.


McEnany didn't provide the answer reporters wanted - a sound bite that would hurt Trump - but she repeatedly responded by saying the president wasn't taking a position on the Confederate flag and that the gist of his message was that NASCAR fans were wrongly being portrayed as being racist.


The AP said she sounded "exasperated" during the briefing.


The AP's story echoed a Washington Post op-ed column earlier this month by ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl, who also is president of the White House Correspondents Association.


Karl argued, "denying reality and using the White House podium for purely political purposes is a violation of public trust."


Yet McEnany's quick wit and combative style have made her a hero of some Trump supporters, since she gave her first briefing on May 1 after taking over as press secretary in April.


The pressers had been absent for more than a year before her appointment.


Like other aspects of political life in Washington, the White House press secretary's relationship with the media has changed dramatically in the Trump era.


That change has come from both sides and predated McEnany's arrival.


A roast of former press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders by comedian Michelle Wolf at the White House Correspondents" dinner in April 2018 was so vicious that even MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski called it "deplorable."


AP White House reporter Jill Colvin greeted McEnany at her first briefing by asking, "Will you pledge never to lie to us from that podium?"


Fox News political analyst Brit Hume, a veteran of more than 50 years in journalism who had a 1989-1996 stint as ABC's chief White House correspondent, said reporters today display "aggressive behavior" in the briefing room because of their contempt for Trump.


It is because of their anti-Trump focus, he said this week on Fox's Tucker Carlson Tonight program, journalists are neglecting to gather policy news.


"It's not just a gotcha game," Hume said of the intended purpose of the pressers.


"It's not just an attempt to embarrass a public official. It's to extract information.


Courthouse set on fire during protest in California


OAKLAND, Ca. -- Protesters in California set fire to a courthouse, damaged a police station and assaulted officers after a peaceful demonstration intensified late Saturday, Oakland police said.


Demonstrators broke windows, spray painted graffiti, shot fireworks and pointed lasers at officers, the Oakland department said on Twitter.


Several tweets called for peace and asked organizers to "help us provide safe spaces and safe places for demonstrators."


The protest began earlier Saturday evening with groups such as the "Wall of Moms," similar to a group that formed in Portland, Oregon, as protesters faced off with U.S. agents deployed to that city to guard a federal courthouse.


President Donald Trump had sent the federal agents to clamp down on protests that have occurred nightly since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.


The protest in Oakland began peacefully, but turned violent later into the night.


An "unlawful assembly" was declared by police around 11:30 p.m. and officers asked the crowd to disperse.


The fire broke out at the Alameda County Superior Courthouse and was contained a short time later, news outlets reported.


Police said protesters at one point were "breaking windows and chanting racial slurs at residents."


Photos tweeted by the department showed broken glass and paint splattered at a police building.


Senior UN official skips Pakistan visit, citing flight issue


ISLAMABAD (AP) - The incoming president of the United Nations General Assembly announced Sunday that he was postponing a scheduled visit to Pakistan "due to some technical flight problems."


Turkish diplomat Volkan Bozkir was elected president of the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly last month and was scheduled to arrive in Islamabad on Sunday.


But in a Twitter post, he said the visit to Pakistan's capital would have to wait.


Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi tweeted in response to Bozkir that "I look forward to welcoming you to Pakistan soon for a constructive and fruitful visit."


A day earlier, a jubilant Qureshi, while announcing the visit, had hoped he would discuss a range of issues with Bozkir, including Kashmir, which is split between Pakistan and neighboring India and claimed by both in its entirety.


Pakistan and India have fought two of their three wars over the disputed region since gaining independence from British rule in 1947.


The two sides often exchange fire in Kashmir, causing troops and civilian casualties on both sides.


Pakistan wants the United Nations to play its role in resolving the issue of Kashmir under its resolutions by allowing people living in the Himalayan region to decide whether they want to merge with India, with Pakistan or whether they prefer independence.


Paul Pogba drops hint over his future after Man Utd seal Champions League spot


Manchester United star Paul Pogba has suggested he will stay at the club this summer after the Red Devils sealed a place in the top four.


A 2-0 win against Leicester meant United finished in third, ahead of Frank Lampard's Chelsea.


United were 14 points off Leicester just 12 matches ago but a sensational run of form saw the Red Devils finish in the top four.


Pogba had been expected to leave the club this summer after twice requesting to leave in the last two years.


However, the pandemic means few clubs will be spending big this summer and there's not a buyer available that could combine a transfer fee and Pogba's salary to entice him away from Old Trafford.


That clarification has helped Pogba in recent weeks as his performances, as well as his body language, have improved.


And the Frenchman has dropped the latest hint that he's set to stay at the club by posting on his Instagram after his side's 2-0 win.


While Pogba may have been simply celebrating the club's return to the competition, many fans are interpreting it as a strong suggestion that he'll still be at the club as they compete with Europe's best again.


Pogba has a year to run on his existing deal, though the club can extend that by 12 months meaning he effectively has two years to run.


United are keen on extending Pogba's deal and they want clarity over his situation before next season.


Pogba, for his part, feels comfortable at the club and has been buoyed by the arrival of Bruno Fernandes.


The Portuguese playmaker has been a revelation at Old Trafford and his arrival has allowed Pogba to play in a deeper central midfield position, which has also improved his mood.


Watford relegated from Premier League as Aubameyang fires Arsenal win


Some of Watford's players sank to their knees; others made for the tunnel without a moment's delay.


The whistle had just blown on their five years in the Premier League and nobody could say that, when the occasion demanded them to hurl the kitchen sink at Arsenal, they went down without a fight.


This was a performance full of the crispness, urgency and aggression that have hallmarked their best work over the last half-decade but it came too late, as did the fightback that almost completely overhauled a three-goal deficit on the day.


Had Emiliano Martínez not brilliantly saved Danny Welbeck's backheel 16 minutes from time, shortly after his former teammate had tapped in to put Watford within two goals of safety, there is every chance they could have completed a comeback for the ages.


In the end they fell short and their caretaker manager, Hayden Mullins, might reflect that he would have never been handed this most thankless of tasks if his team had shown comparable application previously.


Across the season they have not been good enough, but then nor has the organisation that employs them.


One poor campaign may not wreck an empire, but nor do the foundations put in place by the Pozzo family offer any kind of guarantee they will sail straight back up from the second tier.


It is hard to escape the sense that Watford's habit of flipping managers has run out of road.


Their next permanent - perhaps in the loosest sense of - appointment will be the 12th in eight years and there is only so much fresh air a new broom can sweep in.


Troy Deeney faces up to relegation despite getting on the scoresheet at the Emirates.


Players will depart, Ismaïla Sarr showing again here that it should be inconceivable he will be playing Championship football in September, and a steady hand should be a priority.


There was nothing stable about the boom-or-bust fare in an encounter Mikel Arteta described as "a bit of a basketball game," although it certainly made for fine entertainment.


Arteta said afterwards Watford's forwards had been "cheating," although he quickly clarified that as a football term for "gambling, staying up front."


They certainly needed to: any suggestion a battling point might eventually suffice was quickly scotched and they might wonder how things would have transpired if they had not been obliged to play catch-up.


Instead they conceded a penalty almost immediately.


Craig Dawson had bundled carelessly into Alexandre Lacazette within 40 seconds but it took VAR almost three minutes to be confident of awarding the spot kick, which Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang dispatched unfussily.


Watford gathered themselves to press relentlessly, with Sarr in electric form on the right, and came close through Roberto Pereyra and Troy Deeney.


But then Aubameyang teed up Kieran Tierney for a deflected second and, at the first drinks break, the game had been so oddly skewed that Arteta was the manager tearing a strip off his players despite Arsenal's advantage.


Aubameyang then controlled Tierney's long throw and converted a masterful overhead kick that left him one goal short of the golden boot, an award he would have shared with Jamie Vardy if Ben Foster had not blocked one last chance near the end.


Watford appeared done for but they persevered and, after David Luiz had produced another rash penalty-area challenge for the album on Welbeck, Deeney rammed in his own penalty before the break.


Deeney, walking wounded for most of the season, hauled himself around the pitch and was in gladiator mode throughout.


He would probably have gobbled up the chance Adam Masina missed early in the second period and further openings were spurned, too.


Welbeck was thwarted for a first time by the excellent Martínez, who Arteta confirmed will start Saturday's FA Cup final, and then had the entire Watford contingent pitchside on their feet upon converting a fizzing cross from Sarr.


But Watford's prospects faded when his next effort was repelled and the soul-searching, from top to bottom, will need to be extensive.


Famously clear Lake Tahoe has been polluted by climate change


South Lake Tahoe, California - Despite the pandemic, even on a weekday, people still crowd Pope Beach at Lake Tahoe.


"I like camping and having a bike ride and going swimming at the Lake," said one girl named Dakota.


"This is something beautiful everybody wants to visit," said Emerica Benitas.


Which is why Matt Meunier's dive business is still going strong, even in a pandemic.


He says he sees "exceptional clarity. Lake Tahoe is the cleanest, most wonderful lake, I think, in the country."


Now the bad news: Lake Tahoe's not as clean, not as clear, as it used to be when he moved here over two decades ago.


"The thing that we're noticing more and more is down on the rocks," Meunier said.


"You're getting this strange algae on the rocks."


Climate change, scientists believe, has affected the water temperature and thus, the clarity.


And 15 million people visit the lake annually - along with the garbage they leave.


Meunier said dive trips to clean up the bottom of the lake found old trash.


"And when I say old trash, I mean '60s, '70s," Meunier said.


"Beer cans, soda cans, church key cans from the old days."


Scientists monitor the clarity of Lake Tahoe every year by dropping a white disc, then measuring how far down they can see it.


UC Davis professor Geoff Schladow said it's an "important indicator of how healthy the lake is."


When it was measured last year, the clarity of the lake was about 80 feet.


That means you can see that disc 80 feet down.


But, consider this, about 20 years ago, the clarity of lake was 100 feet.


That's the trend scientists are trying to reverse.


But they're fighting the impacts of climate change, development around the lake and something added to the lake in the 1960's: A tiny invasive shrimp brought in to feed the fish.


It didn't work.


"Once the shrimp came in, there were suddenly no natural cleaners in the lake," Schladow said.


Similar challenges are facing lakes and bodies of water around the world.


"The lesson here is, if you can't do it at Tahoe, then what hope is there for all the rivers and estuaries, streams and lakes around the country that are never going to have the same degree of attention, the same level of resources?" Schladow said.


Meunier said he is "hopeful" because "if there's a silver lining of our pandemic, I think it showed that nature will come back and heal itself if we just relieved that pressure, that human pressure, off of it and allow it to happen.  There's facts there now."


QB Herbert among 4 draft picks signed by Chargers


COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) - The Los Angeles Chargers have signed four of their draft picks, including quarterback Justin Herbert, and have agreed to terms with the other two members of their draft class.


The Chargers were able to get contracts done with their draft class on Saturday when they reported to training camp for physicals and equipment.


Along with Herbert, who was selected with the sixth overall pick, the team announced the signings of wide receivers Joe Reed (fifth round) and KJ Hill (seventh round) along with sixth-round safety Alohi Gilman.


They have agreed to terms with first-round linebacker Kenneth Murray Jr. and running back Joshua Kelley, who was selected in the fourth round.


Herbert started 42 games at Oregon, compiling a 29-13 record with 10,541 passing yards and 108 total touchdowns.


He led the Ducks to the Pac-12 championship last season, throwing 32 touchdowns and six interceptions in 14 games.


He capped his career with a win over Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl, where he ran for three touchdowns and was named the offensive MVP.


Herbert will compete with veteran Tyrod Taylor for the starting job.


The Chargers will have a new quarterback after Philip Rivers departed via free agency after 14 seasons as the starter.


Murray was the 23rd overall pick after Los Angeles traded with New England to move back into the first round.


He was a third-team Associated Press All-America selection selection last season after leading the Sooners with 102 tackles, including 69 solo.


Barcelona 'have whole side to sell' this summer as Coutinho, Dembele, Rakitic and Vidal all listed for transfers


BARCELONA will be known as a selling club this summer, according to reports.


No fewer than 12 first team stars have been transfer-listed by the La Liga giants, claim Marca.


Philippe Coutinho has been reportedly transfer-listed by Barcelona


And those include Premier League targets Philippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti.


Coutinho and Umtiti have both been linked with moves to Arsenal, with the Brazilian also being eyed up by Chelsea.


While Manchester United and Tottenham are said to be in a battle for Rakitic's services.


French World Cup winner Dembele, who has struggled for game time at the Camp Nou, was recently linked with a move to PSG in a swap deal with Neymar.


The other players who are deemed surplus to requirements include Neto, Nelson Semedo, Junior Firpo, Arturo Vidal, Martin Braithwaite, Carles Alena, Rafinha Alcantara, and Jean-Clair Todibo.


Barcelona are hoping a clear out will not only boost their finances, but aid their future transfer business.


Ousmane Dembele is also said to be surplus to requirements


According to the Spanish newspaper, Barcelona have already identified their transfer targets for next season - with Argentinian forward Lautaro Martinez top of their hit list.


But Inter Milan are continuing to ask for his £101million release clause to be met before negotiating with the Catalans.


Barcelona will have to sell before they can buy, but remain confident that they can strike a deal with the Serie A side.

Car drives through crowd, protester shot in Colorado


AURORA, Colo. (AP) - A car drove through a crowd and a protester was shot in the suburban Denver suburb of Aurora during demonstrations against racial injustice.


The Aurora Police Department said on Twitter that protesters were walking on Interstate 225 Saturday when a vehicle drove through.


Police said a protester fired a weapon, striking at least one person who was taken to a hospital in stable condition.


Authorities said the vehicle was towed and they are investigating.


Protesters also broke windows to the courthouse and a fire was started in an office, police said.


An unlawful assembly was declared and police ordered protesters to leave the area, authorities said.


Tensions have been heightened at recent protests against racial injustice since federal officials were sent to quell demonstrations in Portland, Oregon.


Police declared a riot in Seattle on Saturday.


Protests sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man in Minnesota who died after a white officer held him to the ground with a knee to his neck, have also highlighted other cases of fatal police violence.


In Colorado, protesters have been drawing attention to the death of Elijah McClain, who was stopped by police while walking down an Aurora street in August 2019 after a 911 caller reported him as suspicious.


Police placed him in a chokehold, and paramedics administered 500 milligrams of ketamine, a sedative, to calm him down.


He went into cardiac arrest, was later declared brain dead and taken off life support.


Labour anti-Semitism whistleblowers demand Corbyn be expelled or face lawsuit


Labour could have to pay damages of between £3million and £8million, according to reports.


Now leader Keir Starmer is under pressure to expel Mr Corbyn.


Last night ex-party staff said they would drop the legal action if Mr Corbyn was ejected from the party.


The Labour Party has so far declined to comment on the demand.


However, Labour MP Jon Trickett said: "It is a ridiculous demand."


Supporters of Mr Corbyn said Mr Starmer needs to focus on tackling the Tories handling on coronavirus instead of delving back into Labour's internal divisions.


An ex-Labour Party source told the Daily Mail they would take legal action even if Mr Starmer did expel Mr Corbyn.


"I mean he's really, he's made the Labour party competitive again.


"There is still a long way to go on policy but he's made a really impressive start and he's got to a situation where for a lot of people who had really given up on the Labour party, voters as it were, I think they are now looking at it again much more sympathetically and they regard him as a serious figure."


Mr Blair did have concerns Labour is still seen as the party that raises taxes.


He said: "My experience with tax when you're in the Labour Party is be really careful because the public out there aren't sitting there worried as to whether you are going to raise taxes or not, they are probably worried that you are going to raise taxes so you've just got to be mindful of that concern."


Covid-19 will permanently change the world's economy (opinion)


Virus screening is likely to become part of our life, just like security measures became ubiquitous after 9/11.


It is important to invest in the infrastructure necessary to detect future viral outbreaks.


This investment protects economies in case immunity to Covid-19 turns out to be temporary.


Many economies adopted versions of Germany's Kurzarbeit (short work) subsidy during the pandemic.


This policy keeps workers employed at reduced hours and pay, with the government compensating some of the shortfall in wages.


By keeping matches between firms and workers intact, the economy is better prepared for a quick recovery.


It is important to improve the implementation of these policies and make them a permanent part of our economic recovery tool kit.


Remote work is likely to become more common.


We had some evidence that working from home is at least as productive as working at the office.


However, many companies were reluctant to embrace remote work.


Now that many have tried it with good results, remote work might be here to stay.


The pandemic crisis has accelerated the pace of digital transformation, with further expansion in e-commerce and increases in the pace of adoption of telemedicine, videoconferencing, online teaching and fintech.


Companies with international supply chains are dealing with shortages and bottlenecks.


We are likely to see many of these companies reshore some of their production.


Unfortunately, this trend will not create many jobs because most of the production is likely to be automated.


Governments will be bigger after playing the role of insurer and investor of last resort during the crisis.


Public debt will balloon, creating financial challenges around the world.


The most important lesson from the Covid-19 pandemic is the importance of working together on problems that affect the entire human race.


We are much stronger united than divided.


Billboard giants push for discounts from airports, councils


oOh! Media raised capital earlier this year to provided more financial certainty as the pandemic started to spook advertisers.


Sources said that the companies were discussing ways to offset the large declines through a rent reduction for the sites they operate or through the removal or reduction of a minimum revenue guarantee, which is typically introduced when a deal is first signed.


One source indicated that the large billboard companies may have guaranteed as much as 85 per cent of their revenue projections in rent.


Some contracts have clauses that allow them to reduce the minimum guarantee if the amount of people in an area reduces by a certain percentage, but it is unclear whether this condition is in any of the current contracts between the billboard companies and their landlords.


At the same time, the companies are offering large discounts to advertisers to fill available slots on billboards and give them the most value for money possible.


Billboards in Sydney CBD and outer suburbs that typically host six ads are struggling to fill all of the available slots.


But some sites - such as oOh!media's 40 x 10 metre billboard at Sydney Airport - have been upgraded.


oOh! Media declined to comment, but at a Macquarie Australia conference in May, it flagged more than $20 million in fixed rent expense savings.


JC Decaux declined to comment.


Airports and public transport are lucrative advertising contracts for billboard companies.


According to the 2019 Outdoor Media Association Report, revenue from transport - including airports - was $169.4 million while revenue from street furniture and and the outside of buses and trams was $266.5 million.


JC Decaux business has contracts with Sydney Airport, Yarra Trams, Perth Airport and Sydney Buses.


oOh! Media has billboards in areas such as Qantas lounges, outside Sydney airport, Adelaide Airport, Darwin Airport and inside train stations in Sydney and Melbourne.


Tenders for Melbourne Airport and Sydney Trains have been taking place during the pandemic and an official decision has not been made.


Melbourne is the second largest airport contract in Australia and pre-coronavirus was worth tens of millions each year.


At full year results in February, oOh! Media said it generated $65.9 million from its 'fly' category, which is predominantly made up of revenue from Sydney Airport.


Revenue from 'commute', which is made up of the rail contracts and street furniture previously owned by Adshel before it was bought by oOh!, was $234.8 million.


JC Decaux Australia made $37.7 million in revenue from transport in 2018, according to its 2018 financial results filed to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.


But both figures are likely to be significantly smaller this year.


Standard Media Index figures, which report the spend of four of the five major ad agency groups, said that the outdoor advertising market had plummeted 68 per cent in June.


By comparison, interim June results show that digital spending is down 37 per cent, while metropolitan radio had fallen 48 per cent.


Metropolitan television fell 34 per cent in June, newspaper spending dropped by 49 per cent and spending in magazines plummeted 66 per cent.


You all know the truth of what I'm going to say.


I think the intuition that inequality is divisive and socially corrosive has been around since before the French Revolution.


What's changed is we now can look at the evidence, we can compare societies, more and less equal societies, and see what inequality does.


I'm going to take you through that data and then explain why the links I'm going to be showing you exist.


But first, see what a miserable lot we are.


(Laughter) I want to start though with a paradox.


This shows you life expectancy against gross national income -- how rich countries are on average.


And you see the countries on the right, like Norway and the USA, are twice as rich as Israel, Greece, Portugal on the left.


And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all.


There's no suggestion of a relationship there.


But if we look within our societies, there are extraordinary social gradients in health running right across society.


This, again, is life expectancy.


These are small areas of England and Wales -- the poorest on the right, the richest on the left.


A lot of difference between the poor and the rest of us.


Even the people just below the top have less good health than the people at the top.


So income means something very important within our societies, and nothing between them.


The explanation of that paradox is that, within our societies, we're looking at relative income or social position, social status -- where we are in relation to each other and the size of the gaps between us.


And as soon as you've got that idea, you should immediately wonder: what happens if we widen the differences, or compress them, make the income differences bigger or smaller?


And that's what I'm going to show you.


I'm not using any hypothetical data.


I'm taking data from the U.N. -- it's the same as the World Bank has -- on the scale of income differences in these rich developed market democracies.


The measure we've used, because it's easy to understand and you can download it, is how much richer the top 20 percent than the bottom 20 percent in each country.


And you see in the more equal countries on the left -- Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden -- the top 20 percent are about three and a half, four times as rich as the bottom 20 percent.


But on the more unequal end -- U.K., Portugal, USA, Singapore -- the differences are twice as big.


On that measure, we are twice as unequal as some of the other successful market democracies.


Now I'm going to show you what that does to our societies.


We collected data on problems with social gradients, the kind of problems that are more common at the bottom of the social ladder.


Internationally comparable data on life expectancy, on kids' maths and literacy scores, on infant mortality rates, homicide rates, proportion of the population in prison, teenage birthrates, levels of trust, obesity, mental illness -- which in standard diagnostic classification includes drug and alcohol addiction -- and social mobility.


We put them all in one index.


They're all weighted equally.


Where a country is is a sort of average score on these things.


And there, you see it in relation to the measure of inequality I've just shown you, which I shall use over and over again in the data.


The more unequal countries are doing worse on all these kinds of social problems.


It's an extraordinarily close correlation.


But if you look at that same index of health and social problems in relation to GNP per capita, gross national income, there's nothing there, no correlation anymore.


We were a little bit worried that people might think we'd been choosing problems to suit our argument and just manufactured this evidence, so we also did a paper in the British Medical Journal on the UNICEF index of child well-being.


It has 40 different components put together by other people.


It contains whether kids can talk to their parents, whether they have books at home, what immunization rates are like, whether there's bullying at school.


Everything goes into it.


Here it is in relation to that same measure of inequality.


Kids do worse in the more unequal societies.


Highly significant relationship.


But once again, if you look at that measure of child well-being, in relation to national income per person, there's no relationship, no suggestion of a relationship.


What all the data I've shown you so far says is the same thing.


The average well-being of our societies is not dependent any longer on national income and economic growth.


That's very important in poorer countries, but not in the rich developed world.


But the differences between us and where we are in relation to each other now matter very much.


I'm going to show you some of the separate bits of our index.


Here, for instance, is trust.


It's simply the proportion of the population who agree most people can be trusted.


It comes from the World Values Survey.


You see, at the more unequal end, it's about 15 percent of the population who feel they can trust others.


But in the more equal societies, it rises to 60 or 65 percent.


And if you look at measures of involvement in community life or social capital, very similar relationships closely related to inequality.


I may say, we did all this work twice.


We did it first on these rich, developed countries, and then as a separate test bed, we repeated it all on the 50 American states -- asking just the same question: do the more unequal states do worse on all these kinds of measures?


So here is trust from a general social survey of the federal government related to inequality.


Very similar scatter over a similar range of levels of trust.


Same thing is going on.


Basically we found that almost anything that's related to trust internationally is related to trust amongst the 50 states in that separate test bed.


We're not just talking about a fluke.


This is mental illness.


WHO put together figures using the same diagnostic interviews on random samples of the population to allow us to compare rates of mental illness in each society.


This is the percent of the population with any mental illness in the preceding year.


And it goes from about eight percent up to three times that -- whole societies with three times the level of mental illness of others.


And again, closely related to inequality.


This is violence.


These red dots are American states, and the blue triangles are Canadian provinces.


But look at the scale of the differences.


It goes from 15 homicides per million up to 150.


This is the proportion of the population in prison.


There's a about a tenfold difference there, log scale up the side.


But it goes from about 40 to 400 people in prison.


That relationship is not mainly driven by more crime.


In some places, that's part of it.


But most of it is about more punitive sentencing, harsher sentencing.


And the more unequal societies are more likely also to retain the death penalty.


Here we have children dropping out of high school.


Again, quite big differences.


Extraordinarily damaging, if you're talking about using the talents of the population.


This is social mobility.


It's actually a measure of mobility based on income.


Basically, it's asking: do rich fathers have rich sons and poor fathers have poor sons, or is there no relationship between the two?


And at the more unequal end, fathers' income is much more important -- in the U.K., USA.


And in Scandinavian countries, fathers' income is much less important.


There's more social mobility.


And as we like to say -- and I know there are a lot of Americans in the audience here -- if Americans want to live the American dream, they should go to Denmark.


(Laughter) (Applause) I've shown you just a few things in italics here.


I could have shown a number of other problems.


They're all problems that tend to be more common at the bottom of the social gradient.


But there are endless problems with social gradients that are worse in more unequal countries -- not just a little bit worse, but anything from twice as common to 10 times as common.


Think of the expense, the human cost of that.


I want to go back though to this graph that I showed you earlier where we put it all together to make two points.


One is that, in graph after graph, we find the countries that do worse, whatever the outcome, seem to be the more unequal ones, and the ones that do well seem to be the Nordic countries and Japan.


So what we're looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality.


It's not just one or two things that go wrong, it's most things.


The other really important point I want to make on this graph is that, if you look at the bottom, Sweden and Japan, they're very different countries in all sorts of ways.


The position of women, how closely they keep to the nuclear family, are on opposite ends of the poles in terms of the rich developed world.


But another really important difference is how they get their greater equality.


Sweden has huge differences in earnings, and it narrows the gap through taxation, general welfare state, generous benefits and so on.


Japan is rather different though.


It starts off with much smaller differences in earnings before tax.


It has lower taxes.


It has a smaller welfare state.


And in our analysis of the American states, we find rather the same contrast.


There are some states that do well through redistribution, some states that do well because they have smaller income differences before tax.


So we conclude that it doesn't much matter how you get your greater equality, as long as you get there somehow.


I am not talking about perfect equality, I'm talking about what exists in rich developed market democracies.


Another really surprising part of this picture is that it's not just the poor who are affected by inequality.


There seems to be some truth in John Donne's "No man is an island."


And in a number of studies, it's possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarchy.


This is just one example.


It's infant mortality.


Some Swedes very kindly classified a lot of their infant deaths according to the British register of general socioeconomic classification.


And so it's anachronistically a classification by fathers' occupations, so single parents go on their own.


But then where it says "low social class," that's unskilled manual occupations.


It goes through towards the skilled manual occupations in the middle, then the junior non-manual, going up high to the professional occupations -- doctors, lawyers, directors of larger companies.


You see there that Sweden does better than Britain all the way across the social hierarchy.


The biggest differences are at the bottom of society.


But even at the top, there seems to be a small benefit to being in a more equal society.


We show that on about five different sets of data covering educational outcomes and health in the United States and internationally.


And that seems to be the general picture -- that greater equality makes most difference at the bottom, but has some benefits even at the top.


But I should say a few words about what's going on.


I think I'm looking and talking about the psychosocial effects of inequality.


More to do with feelings of superiority and inferiority, of being valued and devalued, respected and disrespected.


And of course, those feelings of the status competition that comes out of that drives the consumerism in our society.


It also leads to status insecurity.


We worry more about how we're judged and seen by others, whether we're regarded as attractive, clever, all that kind of thing.


The social-evaluative judgments increase, the fear of those social-evaluative judgments.


Interestingly, some parallel work going on in social psychology: some people reviewed 208 different studies in which volunteers had been invited into a psychological laboratory and had their stress hormones, their responses to doing stressful tasks, measured.


And in the review, what they were interested in seeing is what kind of stresses most reliably raise levels of cortisol, the central stress hormone.


And the conclusion was it was tasks that included social-evaluative threat -- threats to self-esteem or social status in which others can negatively judge your performance.


Those kind of stresses have a very particular effect on the physiology of stress.


Now we have been criticized.


Of course, there are people who dislike this stuff and people who find it very surprising.


I should tell you though that when people criticize us for picking and choosing data, we never pick and choose data.


We have an absolute rule that if our data source has data for one of the countries we're looking at, it goes into the analysis.


Our data source decides whether it's reliable data, we don't.


Otherwise that would introduce bias.


What about other countries?


There are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals.


This isn't confined to these countries here, hiding a very simple demonstration.


The same countries, the same measure of inequality, one problem after another.


Why don't we control for other factors?


Well we've shown you that GNP per capita doesn't make any difference.


And of course, others using more sophisticated methods in the literature have controlled for poverty and education and so on.


What about causality?


Correlation in itself doesn't prove causality.


We spend a good bit of time.


And indeed, people know the causal links quite well in some of these outcomes.


The big change in our understanding of drivers of chronic health in the rich developed world is how important chronic stress from social sources is affecting the immune system, the cardiovascular system.


Or for instance, the reason why violence becomes more common in more unequal societies is because people are sensitive to being looked down on.


I should say that to deal with this, we've got to deal with the post-tax things and the pre-tax things.


We've got to constrain income, the bonus culture incomes at the top.


I think we must make our bosses accountable to their employees in any way we can.


I think the take-home message though is that we can improve the real quality of human life by reducing the differences in incomes between us.


Suddenly we have a handle on the psychosocial well-being of whole societies, and that's exciting.


Thank you.

Coronavirus: Travellers from Spain told to quarantine


Travellers arriving in the UK from Spain must now quarantine for 14 days, under new coronavirus travel rules.


They were announced on Saturday following a spike in coronavirus cases in Spain, with more than 900 new cases of the virus reported on Friday.


Spanish officials have also warned a second wave could be imminent as major cities have seen cases surge.


Airlines including British Airways have criticised the new measures as "yet another blow" to British holidaymakers.


People currently on holiday in Spain have been advised by the Department of Transport to follow the local rules, return home as normal, and check the Foreign Office's travel advice website for further information.


The Foreign Office is advising against all but essential travel to mainland Spain, however the quarantine measures apply to those returning from mainland Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, such as Majorca and Ibiza.


Foreign Office advice has ramifications for travel insurance.


Among those affected by the new rules is Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who began his holiday in Spain on Saturday.


He is expected to continue his trip as planned and isolate in line with guidance on his return.


Quarantine measures for UK travellers were first introduced in early June.


But after pressure from the aviation and travel industries, the government and devolved administrations published lists of countries exempt from the rules.


British Airways said it was "disappointed" about the latest changes to the government's travel advice and rules, although the airline said its flights were continuing to operate.


It said the move was "throwing thousands of Britons' travel plans into chaos."


The Airport Operators Association said the new measures would "further damage what is already a fragile restart of the aviation sector which continues to face the biggest challenge in its history."


The UK's biggest tour operator, Tui, cancelled its flights due to depart to mainland Spain and the Canary Islands on Sunday.


Customers currently on holiday will be able to return on their intended flight home.


However, budget airline EasyJet said it was "disappointed" and would operate a full schedule in the coming days.


"Customers who no longer wish to travel can transfer their flights without a change fee or receive a voucher for the value of the booking," the company said in a statement.


A spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said the government's quarantine rule change was "disappointing."


"We suggest the government considers lifting the quarantine rules for flights to and from certain regions with lower infection rates, or to places such as the Balearic Islands or the Canaries - which are geographically distinct from mainland Spain - to avoid further damage to the UK inbound and outbound tourism industries," he said.


Spain has so far seen more than 28,000 coronavirus deaths.


On Thursday, it saw the biggest daily increase in infections since its lockdown ended.


Catalonia has become the latest region to crack down on nightlife.


The wealthy north-east region, which is home to Barcelona, ordered all nightclubs to close for two weeks and put a midnight curfew on bars in the greater Barcelona area.


The BBC's Guy Hedgecoe in Madrid says contagion among young people is a particular worry, as they have been gathering in large numbers in cities at night.


France has warned its citizens not to travel to Catalonia while Norway has said it will start quarantining people arriving from Spain.


The government is urging employers to be "understanding of those returning from Spain who now will need to self-isolate."


But Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called for the government to explain in detail how it would support those affected, adding that the news would be "deeply concerning for families who are in caught in Spain or are planning travel."


Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the decision was made after reviewing the latest data earlier on Saturday.


"This reinforces the point that these matters are subject to change at short notice and so my advice is to be cautious about non-essential foreign travel," she said.


John Blackmore, from Hampshire, was due to fly out to his family in Spain with his wife and two young children.


But the new rules mean he has had to cancel, for fears his wife's employer would not be able to accommodate her taking an extra two weeks off to quarantine on their return.


He said he thought it was unlikely they would get a refund for the flight, as it has not been cancelled.


"I'm devastated," he told the BBC.


"I have family in Spain who haven't seen their only grandkids since Christmas."


Lois Stothard, from South Yorkshire, told the BBC she had booked a holiday to Seville as a surprise for her boyfriend's 30th birthday - due to fly out on Sunday morning - but now feels that she cannot travel.


"I'm a keyworker - I'm a teacher - and my boyfriend has work commitments so we cannot quarantine for 14 days when we return," she said.


"We can't get any money back and to change the company want double what I've already paid in fees. I'm very disappointed and upset as we're packed and ready to go."


Leicester happy to hit target of European football says Golden Boot winner Jamie Vardy


Jamie Vardy acknowledged his disappointment at missing out on Champions League football, but said Leicester City achieved their early-season objective of qualifying for Europe.


The Foxes were second in December and third when football restarted after lockdown, but they took just four points from their last five games to finish fifth in the Premier League.


A final-day win over Manchester United would have secured a top-four finish, but Brendan Rodgers" side suffered a 2-0 loss, which Vardy says was the most upsetting aspect.


"It was disappointing, more the way we've ended up losing the game," he said on Sky Sports at full-time.


"But we've said in the dressing room, we targeted behind closed doors to qualify for Europe and we've done that.


"We had the chance to qualify for the Champions League and that was even better, but we'll reflect on it and come back stronger next year.


"It's hard to take, but our main target was Europe and we've managed to do that."


While his team fell short, Vardy himself ended the season as the Premier League's top scorer at 33 years of age, scoring 23 times.


He paid tribute to his team-mates in receiving the award and said there are still plenty of miles left in him at the top level, despite his advancing age.


"I'm delighted, it's all about the team. I wouldn't have been in the position I was for the goals without them and I've put quite a few away.


"I'll have a rest for a bit now and come back for next season ready to go.


Fortunately I don't feel my age, my legs are still fine and touch wood I don't pick up many injuries, so it's about keeping on top of that and come back as strong as I can next year."


'What happened there?!' UFC fighter Correia gets pummelled after turning back on rival mistakenly thinking round is over (VIDEO) - RT Sport News


Brazilian bantamweight Bethe Correia is a UFC veteran but made an amateur error by turning her back on opponent Pannie Kianzad and mistakenly thinking the round was over in their bout on Fight Island, and got tagged as a result.


Coming to the end of the first stanza of their showdown on the undercard in Abu Dhabi, the 37-year-old Correia appeared to mistake the 10-second warning for the actual end of the round, reaching out a glove before turning her back on Kianzad and making her way back to her corner.


The Swedish fighter capitalized without hesitation, tagging her opponent with a right hand before following up with a series of blows to back Correia against the cage.


Momentarily appearing in danger, the Brazilian then regained control to stifle the threat and back Kianzad up before the actual end of the round was called.


"What happened there? Oh my word," the commentary team on ESPN+ were heard exclaiming.


It was just one part of a frustrating night for former bantamweight title challenger Correia, who went down to a unanimous decision defeat which is her third loss in her past four octagon outings and leaves her overall record at 11-5, with one draw.


For the Iranian-born Kianzad, 28, it was a second win on the spin following her victory over Jessica-Rose Clark at UFC Fight Night in Moscow back in November.


Kianzad is now 13-5 overall and 2-1 in the UFC, as the woman known as 'Banzai' aims to shift up the 135lbs rankings.


Elsewhere on the night, Australia's Robert Whittaker edged out England's Darren Till in the middleweight main event, while Russian-born fighter Khamzat Chimaev made history by winning a second bout in 10 days on Fight Island, the shortest-ever period between victories in the modern-era UFC.


Rahul Gandhi Goes To People On Rajasthan Issue


Congress's Rahul Gandhi tweeted a video today attempting to mobilise the people against the BJP over the events in Rajasthan.


Using hashtag #SpeakUpForDemocracy, his Hindia post urged the people to "Unite and raise our voice for democracy."


The Congress is planning a countrywide protest on Monday over the situation in Rajasthan, where the Ashok Gehlot government is struggling to survive.


While the party said a protest will be held outside the Rashtrapati Bhavan, the official residence of President Ram Nath Kovind.


In the video, the Congress has accused the BJP of "Ripping up the constitution and demolishing democracy" while the whole country is fighting the coronavirus.


It has done the same in Madhya Pradesh, the Congress said.


"We demand to immediately convene an assembly session which is within our constitutional rights," the party said in the video.


Rajasthan Governor Kalraj Mishra has turned down one proposal to start an assembly session.


A second one was submitted today which he said he is examining.


Mr Gehlot's government has been in deep crisis after his deputy Sachin Pilot turned rebel with a chunk of MLAs supporting him.


The party has been unable to disqualify the rebels to bring down the majority mark in the assembly.


Mr Pilot -- who was stripped of his posts in the party and the government -- has been given temporary relief from disqualification by the Rajasthan High Court, which held that the Speaker cannot take any action until the larger constitutional question about his powers is decided.


That question will be taken up tomorrow by the Supreme Court, which will also decide whether a court can interfere with the Speaker's decisions.


The Congress stands only one past the majority mark in the 200-member assembly.


Team Pilot claims the support of 30 MLAs, but so far, the evidence points to only 19.


The BJP has 72 and including allies and Independents, it stands at 97.


If the court decides in favour of Mr Pilot, the Congress can lose the second of the three governments it formed in the heartland states following the 2018 assembly elections.


In March, it lost the Kamal Nath-led government in Madhya Pradesh after Jyotiraditya Scindia joined the BJP with 22 of his MLAs.


Seattle Protests: Fires and Pepper Spray as Thousands March Through City


SEATTLE - After weeks of escalating confrontations between protesters and federal authorities in Portland, Ore., a crowd of about 2,000 people mobilized in Seattle on Saturday, marching through the streets and clashing with the police.


Three police officers were injured, including one who was hospitalized with a leg injury caused by an explosive, and 16 protesters were arrested as of early evening, the police said.


Carrying signs such as "Feds Go Home" and shouting chants of "No justice, no peace," the protesters stopped at the site of a future youth detention center and lit buildings there on fire. Some smashed windows of nearby businesses.


The police confronted the crowd in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, deploying flash grenades and pepper spray before they began taking people into custody.


Bipasha Mukherjee, 52, of Kirkland, Wash., said she has been protesting on the streets since May and said it was worrisome to her to see such aggressive tactics by the police.


"This is not the country I immigrated to," said Ms. Mukherjee, who arrived from India more than 30 years ago. "It feels like we are rapidly becoming a fascist state and a police state."


Michaud Savage of Seattle said the protests were aimed at both local authorities and the deployment of federal officers who have waged a crackdown against a long-running protest in Portland. Mr. Savage said the law enforcement tactics in Portland, which have included the use of tear gas and crowd-control munitions, were dangerous and inappropriate.


"It's a very hard slide in an extremely violent direction," Mr. Savage said as he washed his eyes of pepper spray and nursed a wound on his arm from a flash grenade.


The death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May ignited mass protests that drew millions to the streets in dozens of cities, but those demonstrations have waned in most cities.


Seattle and Portland, however, have seen extended demonstrations. Seattle protesters at one point laid claim to several blocks of the Capitol Hill neighborhood and declared an autonomous zone. After a series of shootings there led the police to clear the area, protests had subsided.


Portland, meanwhile, has continued protesting, with some of the heaviest protests around federal buildings in the city. After President Trump issued an executive order to protect statues and federal property, the Department of Homeland Security deployed tactical teams to the city, beginning a series of clashes that have resulted in injured protesters, inspector general investigations and calls from local leaders for federal agents to leave.


Protest crowds in that city have swelled into the thousands, and demonstrations there were continuing. This week, federal officials deployed a tactical team to Seattle, and protesters cited that development as one reason for Saturday's demonstrations.


While the Portland protests have centered in downtown, the demonstrations on Saturday roamed areas east of the downtown core, where the city's federal courthouse is.


Kansas City mayor welcomes federal help in solving murders, but worries about Trump's motives


Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas questioned on Sunday President Trump's motives for sending federal agents into U.S. cities - saying that while he would welcome the help in solving a slew of murders in the Midwestern city, he thinks the move could be more about buoying Trump's reelection chances.


"I was pretty frustrated this week [that] the president mentioned the George Floyd protests, mentioned the Black Lives Matter movement," Lucas, a Democrat, said on "Fox News Sunday" of the recent protests over racial inequality and police brutality.


"That is not the case in Kansas City. We've had year-over-year increases [but] what we need help on is actually clearing some of the unsolved murders."


Lucas added: "Let's try to have a pinpointed and targeted focus on solving murders...I think if you listen to recent statements... we are happy to work with federal agents in a limited scope."


Despite his willingness to have federal agents work with local law enforcement, Lucas said that Trump's rhetoric - specifically in light of the controversy surrounding the tactics employed in Portland, Ore., by the federal agents - has caused many of his constituents to voice concern about the presence of agents on the city streets.


"What we don't need is more fuel on the fire from federal agents to make, I think, an exciting political issue," he said.


Trump on Wednesday announced that he was deploying 100 federal agents to Chicago to help combat rising rates of some crimes - a move that marks an expansion of the White House's intervention into local law enforcement as Trump continues to position himself as the "law and order" president.


The "surge" of agents announced on Wednesday to Chicago and other American cities is part of Operation Legend - named after 4-year-old LeGend Taliferro, who was fatally shot while sleeping in a Kansas City apartment late last month.


While sending federal agents to aid local law enforcement is not unprecedented - Attorney General Bill Barr announced a similar surge effort in December for seven cities that had seen spiking violence - the type of federal agent being sent, and some of their tactics, have raised concerns among state and local lawmakers.


A number of lawmakers from New York to Portland have spoken out against the Trump administration sending the agents to their cities, especially following reports that unidentified federal agents detained protesters in Portland and took them away in unmarked vehicles.


Portland has been hit with near-daily demonstrations against police brutality and systemic racism since the death of George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody on May 25.


Local authorities also have complained that the surges have only exacerbated tensions, and criminal justice experts say the efforts defy explanation because of the unprecedented moment America is living through - with a pandemic, historic unemployment and a mass reckoning over racism and how people of color are treated by police.


£10m fund set up to support Scottish events


Organisers of cultural, community and sporting events are to be offered financial support while they remain affected by lockdown restrictions.


The Scottish government's £10m funding package also aims to help event suppliers.


The government said it was looking at how events could restart safely in the future.


Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the coronavirus pandemic had had a "devastating impact" on the sector.


Scotland's festival scene and sporting events such as the Highland games have been among those affected by restrictions brought in to prevent the spread of Covid-19.


Ms Hyslop said: "Whilst we've had the positive step that drive-in events can resume, most of the sector will be unable to operate for some time to come.


"We've worked closely and constructively with the sector on the challenges they face and they have brought forward some creative ideas on how they can begin to operate safely.


"In addition to providing immediate support, some of this funding will look to bolster innovation and aid the longer-term recovery of the events industry."


The Event Industry Advisory Group said the sector had been one of the first to go into lockdown and would be among the last to fully emerge from it.


Chairman Peter Duthie, who is also chief executive of the SEC in Glasgow, said events contributed about £6bn each year to Scotland's economy.


He said: "Additional funding from government for this important sector is very welcome and much needed, both by the event organisers and the wider supply chain businesses who are being hit exceptionally hard by the ongoing effect of an extended period of lockdown."


One winter morning, a couple of years ago, I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa, and noticed a haze hanging over the city.


I make that drive on most days, so it was unusual that I hadn't noticed this before.


Johannesburg is known for its distinctive skyline, which I could barely see that morning.


It didn't take long for me to realize that I was looking at an enormous cloud of air pollution.


The contrast between the scenic environment I knew and this smog-covered skyline stirred up something within me.


I was appalled by the possibility of this city of bright and vivid sunsets being overrun by a dull haze.


At that moment, I felt an urge to do something about it, but I didn't know what.


All I knew was I couldn't just stand idly by.


The main challenge was, I didn't know much about environmental science air-quality management or atmospheric chemistry.


I am a computer engineer, and I was pretty sure I couldn't code my way out of this air pollution problem.


(Laughter) Who was I to do anything about this issue?


I was but a citizen.


In the following years, I learned a very important lesson, a lesson we all need to take to heart if we are to work towards a better future.


Even if you're not an expert in a particular domain, your outside expertise may hold the key to solving big problems within that domain.


Sometimes the unique perspective you have can result in unconventional thinking that can move the needle, but you need to be bold enough to try.


That's the only way you'll ever know.


What I knew back then was that if I was even going to try to make a difference, I had to get smart about air pollution first, and so I became a student again.


I did a bit of basic research and soon learned that air pollution is the world's biggest environmental health risk.


Data from the World Health Organization shows that almost 14 percent of all deaths worldwide in 2012 were attributable to household and ambient air pollution, with most occurring in low- and middle-income countries.


Ambient air pollution alone causes more deaths each year than malaria and HIV/AIDS.


In Africa, premature deaths from unsafe sanitation or childhood malnutrition pale in comparison to deaths due to air pollution, and it comes at a huge economic cost: over 400 billion US dollars as of 2013, according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.


Now, in my work, I explore new frontiers for artificial intelligence, where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine can find a beneficial footing and help us to make better decisions.


As I thought about the air pollution problem, it became clear that we needed to find a way to make better decisions about how we manage air pollution, and given the scale of the problem, it was necessary to do it in a collaborative way.


So I decided I'd better get to know some people working within the field.


I started to speak to officials from the City of Johannesburg and other surrounding cities, and I engaged the local scientific community, and I also made a few cold calls.


The process of engagement I embarked upon helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the problem.


It also helped me to avoid the trap people in my profession sometimes fall into when trying to innovate, where we are quick to apply a technology before we've firmly grasped the problem at hand.


I began to develop an idea about what I could do to improve the situation.


I started by simply asking myself how I could bring together in some meaningful way my skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence and the expertise of the people I'd reached out to.


I wanted to create an online air-quality management platform that would uncover trends in pollution and project into the future to determine what outcomes can be expected.


I was determined to see my idea translate into a practical solution, but I faced uncertainty and had no guarantee of success.


What I had was a very particular set of engineering skills, skills I'd acquired over my career (Laughter) that were new to people who had been working on the air pollution problem for so many years.


What I have come to realize is that sometimes just one fresh perspective, one new skill set, can make the conditions right for something remarkable to happen.


Our willpower and imagination are a guiding light, enabling us to chart new paths and navigate through obstacles.


Armed with a firmer understanding of the air pollution problem, and having managed to source over a decade's worth of data on air pollutant levels and the meteorological conditions for in and around Johannesburg, my colleagues from South Africa and China and myself created an air-quality decision support system that lives in the cloud.


This software system analyzes historical and real-time data to uncover the spatial-temporal trends in pollution.


We then used new machine learning technology to predict future levels of pollution for several different pollutants days in advance.


This means that citizens can make better decisions about their daily movements and about where to settle their families.


We can predict adverse pollution events ahead of time, identify heavy polluters, and they can be ordered by the relevant authorities to scale back their operations.


Through assisted scenario planning, city planners can also make better decisions about how to extend infrastructure, such as human settlements or industrial zones.


We completed a pilot of our technology that was run over a period of 120 days, covering all of South Africa.


Our results were confirmed when we demonstrated a tight correlation between the forecasting data and the data we were getting on the ground.


Through our leadership, we have brought cutting-edge, world-leading assets that can perform air-quality forecasting at an unprecedented resolution and accuracy, benefiting the city that I drove into one winter morning not very long ago, and thought to myself, "Something is wrong here. I wonder what can be done?"


So here is the point: What if I'd not investigated the problem of air pollution further?


What if I'd not shown some concern for the state of the environment and just hoped that someone, somewhere, was taking care of the matter?


What I have learned is that, when embarking on a challenging endeavor that advances a cause that we firmly believe in, it is important to focus on the possibility of success and consider the consequence of not acting.


We should not get distracted by resistance and opposition, but this should motivate us further.


So wherever you are in the world, the next time you find that there's some natural curiosity you have that is being piqued, and it's about something you care about, and you have some crazy or bold ideas, and perhaps it's outside the realm of your expertise, ask yourself this: Why not?


Why not just go ahead and tackle the problem as best as you can, in your own way?


You may be pleasantly surprised.


Thank you.

As an artist, connection is very important to me.


Through my work I'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected.


I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, where I saw my first icebergs.


I was in awe.


My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy, trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.


The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water, and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake, year after year.


Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves.


Each iceberg has its own individual personality.


They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.


Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end, while others can't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.


It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg, that they're isolated, that they're separate and alone, much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.


But the reality is far from it.


As an iceberg melts, I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere.


As the iceberg melts, it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life.


I approach photographing these icebergs as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again.


It is not a death when they melt; it is not an end, but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life.


Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old.


And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old.


The last pictures I'd like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.


It's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling.


So here it is.


You can see on the left side a small boat.


That's about a 15-foot boat.


And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline.


You can see here, it begins to roll, and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.


This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.


It's about 120 feet above the water, or 40 meters.


And this video is real time.


(Music) And just like that, the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.


Thank you.

Shivraj Singh Chouhan On Testing Covid Positive


Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who on Saturday confirmed he had tested positive for COVID-19, tweeted Sunday morning to say that he is "fine" and to offer his praise for front-line workers in the war on coronavirus.


The Chief Minister also repeated his warnings from yesterday, when he urged people to follow guidelines, such as social distancing and the use of face masks.


"I am fine, my friends. The dedication of coronavirus warriors, who selflessly risk their lives, is praiseworthy. I salute all coronavirus warriors of the state," Mr Chouhan tweeted from Bhopal's Chirayu Hospital, where he was admitted yesterday.


"Keep two metres distance, wash your hands frequently and wear face masks - these are the biggest weapons we have to avoid the coronavirus. I appeal to all people - use these weapons for yourself and your loved ones," he said.


"All of you be careful, stay safe and healthy. This is what I pray to God," Mr Chouhan added.


On Saturday Mr Chouhan had tweeted that he had tested positive for the virus despite his best efforts to avoid infection and warned that "just a little carelessness invites the coronavirus."


Tweeting this morning Mr Chouhan said that despite the threat of infection there was "no need to fear" and urged those showing symptoms to get themselves tested.


"If you are infected, there is no need to fear. Do not hide symptoms but tell doctors immediately, so treatment can be started. Timely treatment will make you healthy," he said.


Madhya Pradesh has nearly 27,000 COVID-19 cases, of which more than 7,600 are active and 799 are deaths linked to the virus.


India has recorded a surge in COVID-19 cases in the past weeks, with over 45,000 new cases detected every day since July 23.


The total number of confirmed coronavirus cases is rapidly approaching 14 lakh; of these more than 4.67 lakh are active cases and over 32,000 are deaths linked to the virus.


The spike in cases, coinciding with the staggered relaxation of lockdown guidelines in non-containment zones of the country, has propelled India to third on the list of most affected nations.


Only the United States (41.78 lakh cases) and Brazil (23.94 lakh cases) are worse off.


Kanye West says he can beat Joe Biden "off of write ins" - RT USA News


Fresh from airing his family's dirty laundry on Twitter, rap enigma Kanye West has once again breathed life into his will-he-won't-he presidential bid, claiming that he could beat Joe Biden on write-in votes alone.


Days after announcing a new album and revealing that he's been trying to divorce wife Kim Kardashian for two years, Kanye West again turned his attention to his 2020 presidential campaign on Saturday, in an all-caps announcement declaring "I CAN BEAT BIDEN OFF OF WRITE INS."


If West is still serious about running for the presidency, write-in votes may be his only path to victory, or indeed any kind of showing.


The rapper announced his candidacy on July 4, past the deadline to file as a candidate in at least six states.


Nevertheless, West pressed ahead and filed the proper papers with the Federal Election Commission (FEC), and managed to get his name on ballots in Oklahoma.


Since then he's held one campaign rally, during which he addressed a crowd clad in a bulletproof vest, delivering his speech without a microphone or podium.


West came out against abortion, weeping as he delivered a pro-Christian message he said would make the media "tell you that I'm crazy."


That much was true, and West's rally was described across news sites and gossip mags as a publicity stunt, evidence of mental illness, or both.


However, a recent poll put West at two percent nationwide, neck and neck with the Libertarian Party's Jo Jorgensen and a point ahead of the Green Party's Howie Hawkins.


While it is extremely unlikely that he could surpass Joe Biden's reputed 48 percent, he could in theory siphon enough votes from Biden to see President Donald Trump clinch a second term - something pundits on both sides suspect may be his plan.


Rock from Mars heads home after 600,000 years on Earth


A small piece of rock will be hurled into space this week on one of the strangest interplanetary voyages ever attempted.


A tiny piece of Martian basalt the size of a 10p coin will be launched on board a US robot probe on Thursday and propelled towards the red planet on a seven-month journey to its home world.


This extraordinary odyssey, the interplanetary equivalent of sending coals to Newcastle, will form a key part of Nasa's forthcoming Mars 2020 expedition.


Space engineers say the rock - which has been donated by the Natural History Museum in London - will be used to calibrate detectors on board the robot rover Perseverance after it lands and begins its search for signs of past life on the planet.


Some of the Martian meteorites we have are very fragile, but we chose this one specifically because it's as tough as old boots


"When you turn on instruments and begin to tune them up before using them for research, you calibrate them on materials that are going to be like the unknown substances you are about to study.


So what better for studying rocks on Mars than a lump that originated there?" said Professor Caroline Smith, the Natural History Museum's curator of meteorites.


Scientists were confident that the rock they were returning to Mars originated on the planet, added Smith, who is also a member of the Mars 2020 science team.


"Tiny bubbles of gas trapped inside that meteorite have exactly the same composition as the atmosphere of Mars, so we know our rock came from there."


It is thought that the Martian meteorite was created when an asteroid or comet plunged into the planet about 600,000 to 700,000 years ago, spraying debris into space.


One of those pieces of rubble swept across the solar system and eventually crashed on to Earth.


That meteorite - now known as SAU 008 - was discovered in Oman in 1999 and has been in the care of the Natural History Museum since then.


Among the instruments fitted to the Perseverance rover is a high-precision laser called Sherloc, which will be used to decipher the chemical composition of rocks and determine if they might contain organic materials that indicate life once existed - or still exists - on Mars.


The inclusion of a piece of SAU 008 is intended to ensure this is done with maximum accuracy.


"The piece of rock we are sending was specifically chosen because it is the right material in terms of chemistry, but also it is a very tough rock," added Smith.


"Some of the Martian meteorites we have are very fragile. This meteorite is as tough as old boots."


Once Perseverance has selected the most promising rocks it can find, it will dump them in caches on the Martian surface.


These will then be retrieved by subsequent robot missions and blasted into space towards Earth for analysis.


Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are?


There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants.


And flowers are a real bugger.


They're really difficult for plants to produce.


They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources.


Why would they go to that bother?


And the answer of course, like so many things in the world, is sex.


I know what's on your mind when you're looking at these pictures.


And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce.


You can take cuttings; they can sort of have sex with themselves; they can pollinate themselves.


But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches.


Evolution works that way.


Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen.


Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before.


As I say, every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these.


And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants.


And that's actually rather useful for forensics and so on.


Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen, and that's a very inefficient process, which is why it gets up our noses so much.


Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it, hoping that your sex cells, your male sex cells, which are held within the pollen, will somehow reach another flower just by chance.


So all the grasses, which means all of the cereal crops, and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen.


But most species actually use insects to do their bidding, and that's more intelligent in a way, because the pollen, they don't need so much of it.


The insects and other species can take the pollen, transfer it directly to where it's required.


So we're aware, obviously, of the relationship between insects and plants.


There's a symbiotic relationship there, whether it's flies or birds or bees, they're getting something in return, and that something in return is generally nectar.


Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation.


The plant gets something, and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else.


Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way.


There are markings on many plants that look like other insects.


These are the anthers of a lily, cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it, the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with.


And there's an orchid that might look to you as if it's got jaws, and in a way, it has; it forces the insect to crawl out, getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else.


Orchids: there are 20,000, at least, species of orchids -- amazingly, amazingly diverse.


And they get up to all sorts of tricks.


They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding.


This orchid, known as Darwin's orchid, because it's one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there's a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid.


And basically what the insect has to do -- we're in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar.


And Darwin said, looking at this flower, "I guess something has coevolved with this."


And sure enough, there's the insect.


And I mean, normally it kind of rolls it away, but in its erect form, that's what it looks like.


Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators, then, just as in human sex, people might start to deceive.


They might say, "I've got a bit of nectar. Do you want to come and get it?"


Now this is a plant.


This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love, and they've evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom.


And this is the mimic.


So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant.


And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic, because the mimic doesn't give it any nectar. It thought it would get some.


So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant, it's also -- if you look very closely just at the head end, you can see that it's got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant, if only some botanist hadn't come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card.


(Laughter) Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom.


This flower with its black dots: they might look like black dots to us, but if I tell you, to a male insect of the right species, that looks like two females who are really, really hot to trot.


(Laughter) And when the insect gets there and lands on it, dousing itself in pollen, of course, that it's going to take to another plant, if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture, you can see that there are actually some patterning there, which is three-dimensional.


So it probably even feels good for the insect, as well as looking good.


And these electron microscope pictures -- here's one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye, have very, very different textures to what an insect might perceive.


And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles.


And under the scanning electron microscope, you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at.


Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect, even to us.


I mean, I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast.


It's a wonderful, amazing thing.


This one's clever. It's called obsidian.


I think of it as insidium sometimes.


To the right species of bee, this looks like another very aggressive bee, and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away, and, of course, covers itself with pollen.


The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects.


And this one doesn't have anything for them.


So it's deceiving on two levels -- fabulous.


(Laughter) Here we see ylang ylang, the component of many perfumes.


I actually smelt someone with some on earlier.


And the flowers don't really have to be that gaudy.


They're sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that'll have it.


This one doesn't smell so good.


This is a flower that really, really smells pretty nasty and is designed, again, evolved, to look like carrion.


So flies love this.


They fly in and they pollinate.


This, which is helicodiceros, is also known as dead horse arum.


I don't know what a dead horse actually smells like, but this one probably smells pretty much like it.


It's really horrible.


And blowflies just can't help themselves.


They fly into this thing, and they fly all the way down it.


They lay their eggs in it, thinking it's a nice bit of carrion, and not realizing that there's no food for the eggs, that the eggs are going to die, but the plant, meanwhile, has benefited, because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic.


Here's arum, arum maculatum, "lords and ladies," or "cuckoo-pint" in this country.


I photographed this thing last week in Dorset.


This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing.


And if you look down into it, there's this sort of dam past the spadix, flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals, little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container.


They drink this fabulous nectar and then they're all a bit sticky.


At night they get covered in pollen, which showers down over them, and then the bristles that we saw above, they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out, covered in pollen -- fabulous thing.


Now if you think that's fabulous, this is one of my great favorites.


This is the philodendron selloum.


For anyone here from Brazil, you'll know about this plant.


This is the most amazing thing.


That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long.


And it does something that no other plant that I know of does, and that is that when it flowers -- that's the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days, it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals.


So instead of having starch, which is the food of plants, it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it's burning fat, metabolizing, about the rate of a small cat.


And that's twice the energy output, weight for weight, than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing.


This thing does something else which is unusual.


Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit, 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade, for two days, but it keeps constant temperature.


There's a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature.


Now why does it do this, I hear you ask.


Now wouldn't you know it, there's some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature.


And they get inside, and they get it all on.


(Laughter) And the plant showers them with pollen, and off they go and pollinate.


And what a wonderful thing it is.


Now most pollinators that we think about are insects, but actually in the tropics, many birds and butterflies pollinate.


And many of the tropical flowers are red, and that's because butterflies and birds see similarly to us, we think, and can see the color red very well.


But if you look at the spectrum, birds and us, we see red, green and blue and see that spectrum.


Insects see green, blue and ultraviolet, and they see various shades of ultraviolet.


So there's something that goes on off the end there.


And wouldn't it be great if we could somehow see what that is, I hear you ask.


Well yes we can.


So what is an insect seeing?


Last week I took these pictures of rock rose, helianthemum, in Dorset.


These are little yellow flowers like we all see, little yellow flowers all over the place.


And this is what it looks like with visible light.


This is what it looks like if you take out the red.


Most bees don't perceive red.


And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very, very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got.


And that's a real fantastic bull's eye.


Now we don't know exactly what a bee sees, any more than you know what I'm seeing when I call this red.


We can't know what's going on in -- let alone an insect's -- another human being's mind.


But the contrast will look something like that, so standing out a lot from the background.


Here's another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies, different filters to match the pollinators.


And that's the sort of thing that it would be seeing.


Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot; it was just attached to the tripod, not killed -- then under ultraviolet light, look at that.


And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light.


So maybe the chemical in that would be useful.


Finally, there's one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern.


And I love the idea of something hidden.


I think there's something poetic here, that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter, the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus.


That's the main use of that filter.


Venus, of course, is the god of love and fertility, which is the flower story.


And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding, they've also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death, and particularly at marriage, which, when you think of it, is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another.


Thank you very much.

Man found with gunshot wounds in Mambourin near Werribee


A man has been rushed to hospital after being shot in Melbourne's west overnight.


Police were called to Mambourin, near Werribee, about 8pm where they found a man aged in his 20s with suspected gunshot wounds to the lower body in Yard St.


The man was taken to hospital with non-life threatening injuries.


Police said the investigation was ongoing.


Sunday with Oliver Spencer: "I won't get dressed up, Sundays are for loungewear'


How does Sunday start?


With me stumbling down the stairs and falling over the dog on my way to make my wife a cup of tea.


If I'm lucky, we'll have escaped London to our coastal house on the Isle of Wight.


The two of us will sit together and look across the water in silence.


It sounds serene...


It is, until 8am when two or three of our boys bang on the door demanding breakfast.


It's bacon and eggs for them, spinach and mushrooms for us; then if the weather's good, we kick the boys out.


We'll swim, paddleboard or take a walk around the beautiful Quarr Abbey, which looks like something straight out of Game of Thrones.


And during lockdown?
