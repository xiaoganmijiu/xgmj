Libya: plan for presidential election on 24 December close to collapse


The chances of Libya staging its first presidential elections on the long planned date of 24 December appeared close to collapse on Sunday after the body overseeing the vote said it was unable to announce the the approved candidates because of continued legal doubts.


With the elections less than a fortnight away and virtually no time for campaigning, a postponement would represent a bitter blow to the international community's hopes of reuniting the deeply divided country.


Foreign powers will also fear the overall momentum towards democracy could dissipate.


In the short term they will have to agree whether or not the interim government continues in order to fill the political vacuum and prevent a return to civil war.


A series of court rulings have overturned the Libyan electoral commission's decisions to block high-profile figures including Saif al-Islam Gaddafi, the son of the former dictator, from standing for the presidency.


The interim prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah and warlord Khalifa Haftar, the head of the self-styled Libyan National Army, have meanwhile been approved by the commission but subsequently appealed by other parties.


It said in a statement on Saturday it said could not announce the names of the approved candidates out of the nearly who 100 have applied because it was "keen to exhaust all means of litigation to ensure its decisions comply with issued judgements."


Rival factions have accused each other of intimidating or bribing judicial officials to secure their reinstatement of their candidates, and the commission is looking to see if the decisions were valid.


In the case of Dbeibah, he had pledged as a condition of becoming interim PM that he would not stand for election but has since argued in court that this was a moral pledge with no legal force.


Saif Gaddafi was convicted in absentia in 2015 on war crimes charges for his part in fighting the revolution that toppled his father, Muammar Gaddafi.


He denies wrongdoing.


The presence of tens of thousands of foreign fighters, mercenaries and indigenous militia make the country a tinderbox, and there are fears an election conducted with disputed candidates would only lead to a result that was not recognized.


In a sign of the tensions over foreign forces, France is pressing the EU to agree on Monday to impose sanctions on the Russian private military contractor Wagner Group, which it says operates in Libya and the Sahel.


Moscow denies Wagner is linked to the Russian state and has said it would retaliate against EU sanctions placed on its citizens.


The international community's ability to demand the Libyan political class stick to the 24 December election date, which was first agreed in February, has been hampered by the appointment of a UN special envoy, Ján Kubiš, who resigned three weeks before the elections after less than a year in the post.


The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has since appointed Stephanie Williams, a forceful former UN deputy special envoy, to act as his special adviser.


Russia vetoed her appointment as a full envoy, but she has deep knowledge of Libya and last year displayed a willingness to confront those in the political class opposed to elections.


The UN mission issued a statement urging all sides not to reverse the gains made, pointing to the registration of nearly 3 million voters, the successful distribution of voter cards and the applications of large numbers of candidates for the presidency and parliament as signs of deep popular support for elections.


The US ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, said "refusing to go to the elections and mobilizing to obstruct will only place the fate and future of the country at the mercy of those inside Libya and their external backers who prefer bullet power over ballot power."


Android hardware Cleaning tip


Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers.


They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles.


I just used this method to clear the microphone port on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering my voice when using speech to text functions.


After months of thinking, I would need to arrange a warranty replacement or need to book a repair.


After much frustration shouting at my watch during phone calls so I could be heard and/or understood.


After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device AND factory restoring my device.


And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions.


There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction.


Then I had a revelation and I tried interdental brushes, and they work...


They work very VERY well!


After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, your device should work just as it did when it was brand new.


*I advise this be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if you decide to use it with any combination of any cleaning product.


South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk


South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy.


De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer.


Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor.


He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994.


De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990.


Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election.


President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor.


"He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees.


I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him.


A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers.


Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions.


Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.


De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority.


Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police.


The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security.


Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid.


In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing.


De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5


An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others.


The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss.


The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier.


The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow.


All were wearing avalanche beacons.


While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort.


The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.


Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion.


"Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest.


They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said


In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour).


The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall.


The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters).


"We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm.


People got excited," DeBerry said.


"We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk."


Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).

I'm still with you


Oh, so glad you asked, I have a lot to say about this.


Yes, there’s been a pretty drastic change.


I have been overweight/obese since I was 3 years old, so existing like that is all I ever knew until age 30.


The vast majority of my family and friends who knew me before treat me the same and are SO.


damn.


supportive.


I do have a select few familial relationships, which were strained to begin with, where it seems that my weight loss has exacerbated the existing problems.


This could be the result of their complexes or mine, because I think they’re used to being able to shit on me and I, in turn, am now even less willing to take their shit.


One person in particular has, very weirdly, tried to take credit for my weight loss.


Basically, they’ve insinuated that they were the driving force that got me here, under the guise of being supportive, when in reality they didn’t even know I was making these changes until I had already gone through with the RNY and lost well over 100lbs.


In fact, they were the last to know, intentionally, because I just didn’t want them to try to take control and bully me into things like I used to let them.


Unsurprisingly, now they’ve taken to insulting my other features, like telling me my nose and forehead look too big since I lost weight and that I need a nose job and bangs to fix it - this is typical behavior from them.


At first, they just private messaged me these things but when I didn’t respond, they took to commenting about it publicly on social media, with no shame.


When I was bigger, that would have destroyed me and I would have listened but now I just ignore it.


Luckily, my skin is thicker now (not just cause it’s in excess these days).


The attention from strangers is by far the weirdest part for me.


When I was bigger, people really didn’t pay me any attention.


Like, little to no eye contact.


No saying hello or smiling at me as we pass on the street unless they knew me.


Definitely no going out of their way to help or compliment me.


It was more isolating than I realized because it’s what I was used to.


I knew people could be judgmental of my size - with many doing so openly - but I never realized, until I lost weight, the micro-level of it and just how subtle it can come about.


Not only was I unaware of it, simply because it’s what I was used to, but I also don’t think those who perpetuate it are actively aware they’re doing it.


I really believe it is a subconscious bias, bred and exacerbated by the portrayal and treatment of overweight people in media, that many people just don’t realize they project.


Now, it feels like everyone everywhere looks at me, smiles at me, talks to me, etc.


Both men and women engage with me differently, making more efforts to talk to/get to know me - and that’s just platonically.


Romantically, my dating pool has expanded from what few were willing to be seen with me to what feels like… everyone lol.


It is DAUNTING.


I assumed that, at the very least, the fact that I was morbidly obese, have lost all this weight and now have excess skin would deter some people, but despite the fact that I put my weight loss and excess skin right at the forefront (because I don’t want it to be a secret), it has bothered/deterred approximately no one in my experience.


It seems to have done the opposite and made them more interested, actually.


Huge shock to me.


I do have to put a little PSA here, though, for men who are newly talking to/dating a woman who has lost weight: comments like “I am so happy you lost the weight, you clearly haven’t realized how gorgeous you are yet” is NOT the way to go.


I have heard some variation of this more times than I care to count and they all thought it was a compliment.


Hey r/Military!


I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries.


Hello everyone!


I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force.


Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29.


You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60.


In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year.


However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission.


If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such.


I am just wondering how is it for other countries?


If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country?


What do you guys think about mandatory military service?


During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada.


Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military.


I know that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, but it would be interesting to hear from other (non-NATO) countries as well.


Sorry for my poor grammar.


English is my second language.


You can also reset it from there.


However I recommend you resetting it from your computer, even if you are logged in on your computer, this is for you to remember your password, as this information is important to know by memory


Once your password is reset from your computer, please try accessing once again on our daughter's e-reader with your new password


please let me know if it works


I enjoy articles like this help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that my dad glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried.


Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills.


While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump,


I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off them later on in life.


To this day, I still refuse to study the history of Poland as that would just allow the paranoid conspiracies of my dad to bubble forward.


Returning to this article, I love the small details that remind you that there actually was one good choice (despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith, and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity.


That's the thing.


Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege.


Then coincidence, serendipity, etc. rarely exist.


The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else you are expensing limited energy on frivolous acts.


But Republicans love to hide behind our more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.


Thank you for taking the time to chat to me today.


Once this chat has ended you will be sent a 'rate my chat' feedback email.


Please kindly fill this in if you have a moment, however if you don't have time then may I wish you a wonderful day and thank you again.

Move the trailer!


Years ago, I worked at a cabinet shop.


I went on an install with the owner, and when we came back he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster.


No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that’s where he left it.


The next morning I come into work and Jerry (not his real name) comes up to me looking pissed about something.


Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella.


The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so I don’t remember exactly).


Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster?


Me: No, the owner drove yesterday.


Jerry: You can’t park that trailer there, then I can’t get to the dumpster!


Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it.


Jerry: I don’t know why you would park that trailer there.


You know we need to have access to the dumpster.


Me: but I didn’t park it there.


Why don’t you talk to the owner about it?


Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah


Me: It was not me.


The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way.


From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.

Family pays tribute to "energetic" 18-year-old stabbed to death in Birmingham


The family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in Birmingham have described him as a "young, energetic 18-year-old" who dreamed of being a digital marketing specialist.


Yahya Sharif was found seriously injured in Coventry Road, Small Heath, just before 5.30pm on Friday, West Midlands Police said.


Police were called to the scene by the ambulance service.


Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Yahya, from Nechells, was confirmed dead at the scene.


A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest.


A statement released on behalf of his family said: "We cannot believe that Yahya has disappeared from our eyes.


We still don't know the reason he was killed.


A young, energetic 18-year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist.


The whole community are shocked.


May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents."


Detectives have been gathering CCTV and other evidence as they try to piece together what happened and identify and trace who stabbed the teenager.


Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him.


This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances.


There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible.


We've spoken to a number of witnesses but we still need to hear from anyone with information who can help us.


I'd appeal for those who were there at the time to do the right thing, come and speak to us and tell us exactly what happened and why.


It's the least Yahya's family deserve."


Anyone with any information should call 101, quoting reference number 3643 10/12/21.


An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me.


When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause).


Had to sign to acknowledge the “damage”.


I also had videos and photos which didn’t cover the bottom of the car.


A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I’d be charged for as well—including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental.


None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle).


None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim.


They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage.


Since it was a work trip, I turned my photos over to our legal department.


I received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction.


If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care.

Your Bought Item will be sent via Royal Mail or a national couriers company.


We try to post the item the same or next working day depending on the purchase time after the payment has been received.


12.00 mid-day is the cut-off time.


There is no order processing or dispatching on public holidays or weekends.


We dispatch all orders accordingly but at some point, it could be possible that your bought item might be out of stock.


In this case, we will notify/contact you either when the item is back in stock ready for us to dispatch or to give you an alternative option.


You will have the right to cancel the order if you wish.


eBay gives an estimated delivery date which does not include any supposed delay by Royal Mail/Couriers.


This can include bad weather, system breakdown or staff strikes etc.


These issues are not in our control so please keep this in mind.


We dispatch items with the expectation of a service being provided by the couriers, but sometimes they do disappoint and this can't be our fault.


If the courier is unable to deliver, a card should be left by the relevant delivery company instructing how to organise a re-delivery or where the parcel has been left for you to collect.


If the parcel has been returned to the courier's depot, then they will allow a certain time for you to collect.


If it is not collected within this time, the parcel will be returned to us.


We would then require you to repay the postage cost for us to re-send the parcel back to you.


If the item is no longer required, a refund will be issued less the postage amount.


If for any reason you are not satisfied with your purchase, you can return the item for a refund within 30 days.


Returns are accepted only if the item is in its original re-sellable condition, which means items must not be used, worn, marked, have no scent, no pet hair or be in a condition that it can't be sold again.


Items must be returned in their original packaging with all product tags attached.


Please be careful when clothing is tried on that make up is not worn, or hair products, fragrances, deodorant or other creams or substances which mark or damage the product.


This will only result in your returned item not being accepted by us for a refund.


We will require a postage payment by you for us to return the item to you.


We will keep or await postage payment for the item for a maximum of 30 days, and after this the item will be disposed of.


Items must be returned within 30 days of receipt.


If the item has arrived faulty or we have sent the wrong item, then we shall pay for the return of the item.


The easiest way would be to open a returns request via eBbay.


Once received, we will examine the item and refund your account.


Items becoming faulty after/during wearing will be subject to an inspection of the item when returned to us.


If the fault is considered a genuine factory fault, then you will be refunded.


If it is not a factory fault, the item will be returned back to you after the postage cost to return the item has been paid.


Again we will wait 30 days for this payment to be made, after which the item will be disposed of.


The easiest way would be to return the item for a refund via Ebay returns, and then simply purchase the size or colour required back from us.


ALL RETURNS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SENDER UNTIL THEY ARRIVE TO US


Please obtain Proof Of Postage from the Post Office Clerk


Positive feedback is always appreciated, but if for whatever reason there is a problem with your purchase, please give us the chance to resolve the issue.


Hopefully, you will find our customer service very satisfactory.


&gt; Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions.


This isn't even necessarily true.


Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS.


That's how most apps work now.


&gt; Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently.


Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough?


It also makes for some terrible UX.


Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time?


And what does "the developers can be confident that their patch/feature will get pushed out in the new release" even mean?


&gt; This is in contrast to Google.


Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share.


I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps.


That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is "better" for the developers, or the end user.

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again


Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.


Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.


Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.


That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.


As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.


However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.


NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.


All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.


This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.


Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.


For your information, I will be sending you a transcript of our conversation.


Should you have any further questions or concerns, you can always reply back to that email and we will be able to assist you further.


It was spilled by our rider accidentally.


For the re-delivery, we will not charge you twice.


We will only send you a new order.


Your re-delivery is now being prepared by the restaurant.


I kindly ask for your patience and wait for your order to be delivered within #NUMBER# minutes.


There was nothing Von so long delivery time on your website


Upon ordering it is to the lead time quoted.


The lead times are as advertised on the website.

The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop.


My neighbors got a dog about three years ago.


These neighbors and I share a fence.


It separates our back yards.


Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite me through the fence the entire time I'm out in the backyard.


I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc.


but this dog is insane.


The maintenance guys are afraid of it.


So I went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help me figure out how to get this dog to chill.


I can't even use my yard at this point.


That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop.


I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence.


Owner says no.


I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar.


Owner says no.


(Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog.)


Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, I hatched a plan.


I bought a very nice portable speaker that is *loud*.


Like, I saved and invested in this.


Now, every time I go to my backyard, I bring my speaker.


There is no daytime noise ordinance here, I checked.


When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up.


My speaker shakes the table.


It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together.


The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it.


The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays.


Edit some grammar errors


Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL.


This can seriously harm and even kill an animal.


Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from JYX, if anyone is interested.


It was under $200, but I'm poor so I had to save for a bit.


It sounds great for the money, though.


I'm impressed and so are my neighbors.

Liz Truss pledges another £75m in aid to Afghanistan at G7 meeting


A further £75 million in aid is to be given to Afghanistan by the UK to help address its worsening humanitarian situation, Liz Truss has announced.


The Foreign Secretary said the commitment would help save lives and "support stability in the region."


It follows discussions among G7 foreign ministers in Liverpool on Saturday about what co-ordinated action can be taken in Afghanistan, along with how to engage with the Taliban rulers.


The militant group stormed Kabul in a lightning advance in August, as 20 years of occupation of the central Asian country was brought to a close with a hurried allied withdrawal.


Ms Truss said: "The UK is providing vital humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan this winter.


The funds announced today will save lives, protect women and girls and support stability in the region.


We are determined to do all we can for the people of Afghanistan."


The additional financial support will bring the UK's commitment to Afghanistan to £286 million this year.


It will be used to provide support for victims of gender-based violence and to fund essential child protection services.


The United Nations and aid agencies will prioritise those most at risk including households headed by women and disabled people, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said (FCDO).


Officials said no funding would go directly through the Taliban, instead being funnelled through the Afghanistan Humanitarian Fund, World Food Programme (WFP) and other organisations.


The WFP will receive £34 million of the funding announced on Sunday.


David Beasley, the organisation's executive director, said the donation would "help us save many lives."


"What we are seeing on the ground is heart-breaking - 23 million people are facing severe hunger in a country crippled by drought, conflict and an economic crisis," he said.


"Women and children are bearing the brunt of this suffering and, as the harsh winter descends, more and more are slipping into malnutrition and starvation each day."


This week the UN's humanitarian chief warned that Afghanistan's economic collapse was "happening before our eyes" and urged the international community to take action to stop "the freefall" before it leads to more deaths.


Martin Griffiths said: "It's getting more and more dire by the week."


The funding announcement comes after ministers this week faced awkward questions about the Afghan withdrawal effort following a whistleblower's evidence to MPs.


Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting, claimed just 5% of Afghan nationals who applied to flee under one UK scheme received help as a result of the "dysfunctional" and "chaotic" handling of the situation.


Mr Marshall told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee that some of those hoping to escape were murdered after being left behind in Kabul.


He also claimed Boris Johnson requested that "considerable capacity" was made available to evacuate animals from a shelter run by former Royal Marine Paul "Pen" Farthing, putting the lives of troops at risk to help aid their departure on a privately funded plane.


The Prime Minister has called the claims "complete nonsense."


At the Museum of Liverpool on Sunday, Ms Truss will have discussions with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, who are attending the G7 gathering for the first time - most of them virtually.


The Foreign Secretary will stress the importance of working with south-east Asia's "economies of the future" to tackle the current challenges facing the West, the FCDO said.


The invitation to Asian ministers comes after the UK's integrated review on foreign policy announced in March a "tilt" towards the Indo-Pacific, in a move seen as aiming to counter China's growing influence in the region.

When it comes to buying quality gear, a sleeping bag needs to be first on the list.


You can scrimp on all manner of kit but not on a sleeping bag.


A lot of your time when out camping or expeditions will be spent in your sleeping and with Snugpak you are assured quality.


A tried and tested favourite, this British made sleeping bag combines micro pack size with serious performance.


Many view the Softie 12 Osprey the ultimate four season synthetic fill sleeping bag available.


Since 1987, it has been setting the standard for winter pack size performance for others to follow.


Those who know about the Softie 12 Osprey have either used one or wished they had one.


Used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole.


The Softie 12 Osprey like many of our other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series have been assigned a NATO Stock Number.


The quilted top of the bag is tailored, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord so it pulls into shape, rather like a jacket hood.


To prevent the 2-way zip from snagging either the zip baffle or the bag edges, an "anti-snag strip" of webbing is sewn in behind the zip.


Liner Fastening and Hanging Tabs Inner tabs are provided to keep a loose liner in position, corresponding in position with the tabs we provide on our liners.


External tabs allow you to easily hang the bag for airing and drying.


Tapering the bag to a circle foot creates the "mummy" shape which is easy to warm and minimises the weight of material used.


Hard to see in the picture, but a zip baffle runs the full length of the bag, behind the zip,to prevent heat escaping through the zip area.


Buy a left and a right hand to make a double (please check when ordering)


Comes complete with a compression stuff sack, to make the bag smaller when not in use.


Can be used with the Snugpak Exanda Panel to make a wider sleeping bag for more comfort.


This sleeping bag can be made extra long.


Single profiled sleeping bag with one layer of softie insulation.


Snugpak are based in a listed mill built in the 1800s on the edge of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales.


They are very proud to be one of the last manufacturers of quality sleeping bags and insulated clothing not only in the UK but across Europe.


We have a dedicated workforce at our West Yorkshire factory in the North of England who are trained to use state-of-the-art machinery and traditional sewing techniques to bring our ideas to life.


Contact Left Limited is an official supplier for Snugpak and carries a large range of their kit in our EBAY shop.


Contact Left LTD is a leading supplier of kit to the Armed Forces and Close Protection Industry


I do apologise about this, we must gain permission from the account holder to discuss an order with another person, I apologise if this was done previously, however, I would not be able to discuss this with yourself without the account holders permission.


I was buying new tires.


I found the ones I wanted on a tire store website.


I printed out the page and took it to my local shop.


It was part of a chain.


The guy at the shop checked things out and it turns out that the current price of the tires was more than my printout.


Don’t know where he got the higher price from.


Luckily, the guy was honest and rather than trying to charge the higher price, he sold me the tires for the price I had on my printout.


He said that because I had the printout, he had to sell me the tires at the printout price.


He was gracious about it too.


Been buying tires from them ever since.


The order was processed as a pick up order that means you chose it to be picked up by you.

I haven’t seen any comments from Australians yet, so I might as well say a few words.


It’s difficult to find equipment that’s unique or out of the mainstream.


Most boards are mass market boards such as sector 9s or Loaded Tan Tien’s … I have both and I’m not hating.


If I want something out of the ordinary, however, I buy direct from the manufacturer or through Muir.


Shipping is always a problem and it’s always expensive.


I really wanted the Tortuga but when it was all priced up, it was over AU$500 (incl. shipping and exchange rate).


Shipping alone was approx. US$100.


I understand this isn't something you have control over … I only wanted to illustrate the considerations and trade-offs made from this side of the world.


Finally, love your boards!


Much respect.


This is the thing people don't get.


The math doesn't say you can't get really sick if you're young and healthy.

I'm healthy in general, but the flu always hits me very hard.


I was scared that Covid was going to be worse.


It wasn't, probably because I didn't get exposed to a lot of the virus, but it was bad enough.

Russia warned of 'consequences' if Ukraine attacked


The Group of Seven has warned Russia of massive consequences and severe costs if President Vladimir Putin attacks Ukraine, according to a draft statement.


US intelligence assesses that Russia could be planning a multi-front offensive on Ukraine as early as next year, involving up to 175,000 troops.


The Kremlin denies it plans to invade and says the West is gripped by Russophobia.


Moscow says the expansion of NATO threatens Russia and has contravened assurances given to it as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.


At a meeting in the northern English city Liverpool, the G7 delegates said they were united in their condemnation of Russia's military build-up near Ukraine and they called on Moscow to de-escalate.


"Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost," the draft statement said, confirmed by G7 sources.


"We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future," the draft said.


For Moscow, the growing NATO embrace of a neighbouring former Soviet republic - and what it sees as the nightmare possibility of alliance missiles in Ukraine targeted against Russia - is a "red line" it will not allow to be crossed.


Mr Putin has demanded legally binding security guarantees that NATO will not expand further east or place its weapons close to Russian territory; Washington has repeatedly said no country can veto Ukraine's NATO hopes.


In 2014, Russia seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine, prompting the West to slap sanctions on Russia.


The Kremlin said today that Mr Putin told US President Joe Biden that Russian troops posed no threat and that Moscow was being demonised for moving troops around its own territory.


Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there were very serious conceptual differences between Russia and the United States on Moscow's "red lines."


The G7 comprises Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States, and includes a representative from the European Union.


"We call on Russia to de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments on transparency of military activities," the G7 said in the draft.


"We reconfirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy Format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk Agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine," the draft said.


China's Xi and Russia's Putin dominate the G7


Pope calls for 'serious international dialogue' to defuse Ukraine tensions


Pope Francis, in his first comments on the tensions between the West and Russia over Ukraine, today called for serious international dialogue to resolve tensions and urged both sides to avoid an armed conflict.


He said he was praying for "dear Ukraine, for all its churches and religious communities and for all of its people, so that tensions there are resolved through a serious international dialogue and not with weapons."


Weapons are not the path to take.


May this Christmas bring peace to Ukraine," the pope told thousands of people in St Peter's Square for his noon blessing and address.


Ukraine is predominantly Orthodox Christian, with Catholics of either the Latin Rite or Byzantine rite making up about 10% of the population in the former Soviet republic.


Separately, Mr Biden has said he told Mr Putin that Russia would pay "a terrible price" and face devastating economic consequences if it invaded Ukraine.

Scholz, Polish prime minister discuss migration, energy, EU


Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki about migration, energy, European Union matters and tensions east of the bloc's border.


He was greeted by Morawiecki, with military honors, in front of the Polish premier's office.


It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday.


Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas directly to Germany saying it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries, and exposes it to pressure from Moscow.


Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues.


The government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there.


Scholz and Morawiecki are also to discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany's new government.


The good neighborly ties are still overshadowed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which is saying Germany owes Poland compensation for wartime damages.


Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, the deputy director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner.


The visit comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratified a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation.


Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday.


She voiced Germany's support for Poland which has sealed its eastern frontier to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarus government to seek illegal passage.


She also called for humanitarian treatment of the migrants stuck at the border.


Poland and the EU say the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration into its countries.


On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels.


Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel's 16-year tenure.


His government is made up of a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.


The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D


The **Enterprise-D** of *The Next Generation* had **three** shuttlebays.


On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13.


These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets.


I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it.


How come we never saw the main shuttlebay?


It was located below the main bridge on decks 3&amp;4 and would presumably be a massive facility.


Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13.


In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life.


Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life.


Couldn't they have done this on TNG?


We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle.


We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space.


The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect."


We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and we get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles.


Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?


My apologies again for the inconvenience this has caused you.


We are still looking ways to improve our services and this will be noted as a feedback to one of our valued customer.


Thank you - so this query is with warehouse as stated in yesterdays chat, we have to await the reply to the investigation.

Is there anything else I can help you with?


I see it all the time in my line of work.


And it doesn’t even have to be life or death to be frustrating.


Had a recent patient who needed a very specific knee procedure to walk normally and improve quality of life.


Peer to peer failed.


Insurance says it’s not medically necessary.


We appeal.


They say no again.


We go to third party appeal.


We submit all the pertinent medical research supporting the need for the procedure.


We even included the second opinion of a different surgeon outside of our program — yeah, he recommends the procedure.


24 hours later, they hit us back with the final “No.


Not medically necessary.”


My surgeon flips his shit and is like “FINE!


But you’re going to fucking tell me which procedure you would recommend, because I don’t know another one that is gonna help this poor kid”.


Of course, they don’t.


And this kid is screwed.


No other option.


As it turns out this procedure is generally hated by insurance because it’s pretty expensive.


We always have to fight for it, but they’ll usually agree after an appeal.


Not this time.


The system is so broken.
