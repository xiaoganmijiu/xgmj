Wang Shun's two idols are Phelps and Lochte. Phelps has obtained his 4th gold medals in Rio while Lochte, due to his poor performance, has ended in ranking fifth.


After the event, Wang Shun's excitement is effusive, "This medal is a bit unexpected and this feeling is too inconceivable and too wonderful."


In fact, during this match, the prospect of Wang Shun was not promising. However, on the strength of the sprint of the last 50 meters, his ranking rose from the 7th to the 3rd all the way. "I only wanted to try my best to do every swimming action well."

At present, China has 31,627 silver screens while the number of silver screens owned by the US is 39,000. Yet the decline at the box office this year may postpone the process of overtaking the US in this regard.

Since the beginning of the second half year, the A-share market has rallied. However, recently the Shanghai Composite Index has fluctuated around 3000 points, indicating the decline in investors' risk appetite.


In the bond market, since June, due to the influence of multiple factors such as fundamentals and investor sentiment, the bond market has taken on a trend of improvement.


Driven by the real estate cycle in the first quarter of this year and influenced by the investment rally in real estate and the improvement of facility investment, the economy has entered phased recovery.


Secondly, since the second quarter, with the weakness of the American economy and the influence of Britain's exit from the EU, the Fed has begun to slow down the pace of raising interest rates.


The asset prices of emerging markets benefit from the loose expectation rally brought by the slow interest rate hikes of the Fed. It is better to actively grasp the investment opportunity of stock market and bond market under this environment.


But judging from a short-term perspective, the further downward movement of the long-term interest rate requires phased risk exposure and the downward movement of capital interest rate.


At the same time, it is also imperative to see that having experienced the big bull market of bonds for two years, the yield rate of the fixed income market this year is hard to reach the level two years ago and the fluctuation range will increase at the same time. So on the whole, yield curve takes on a flat feature.

The Karamay Forum of Silk Road Economic Belt brought down the curtain on Aug. 11.


This forum is not only a direct dialogue about economy and trade, but also an exchange that has expanded to the cultural field from this base for the first time and has made remarkable achievements.

The head of Dongshan said that in the next five years, Dongshan will stick to innovative development, increase and boost growth engines, as well as promote the steady growth of its economy.


It will reinforce the R&D Park's role as the major battlefield for economy, focus on strategic emerging industries like smart power grids, electronic communication and new materials industries with investment invitation as a core, in a bid to promote the expansion of new industries and the innovation of service model.

Hunan Provincial Environmental Protection Department Orders Yiyang Government to Improve Datong Lake's Water Quality


The 82.67-square-kilometer Datong Lake at the center of Dongting Lake has been suffering from agricultural and household wastewater pollution, as well as breeding enterprises' blind pursuit of economic benefits in recent years.


The primary school districts of Rencheng District and Confucius High-tech Zone have been unveiled in recent days, making "school district homes" a hot topic among Jining residents again.


Especially, those who plan to buy homes in the near future attach more importance to the school districts of the real-estate projects they are in favor of, as well as the problem that where their kids will study in the future.


On the morning of August 11, a journalist of Qilu Evening News found in a survey conducted among some real estate projects in the urban area that the property consultants of those projects have learnt the division of the school districts and introduced it to their customers.


"Our community belongs to the school district of Yongfeng Street Primary School. It will be convenient for property owners to send their kids to the school."


A staff at the sales office of a real-estate project called "Taibai International" told the journalist that the staff of the office have learnt the division of the primary school districts of Rencheng District after it was unveiled and have actively publicized the information and explained to their customers.


Zhongyin Joyful City also made active preparations after the school districts of the High-tech Zone were unveiled.


"Our real-estate project belongs to the school district of the primary school of Chong Wen School and the first phase will be delivered at the end of this year."


In addition, some new real-estate projects in Jibei New Area have been included into some school districts as well. For instance, the school district of Jining Experimental Primary School's Renxing department has covered projects like Sino-German Park City, Dejian Graceful Home and Ruihu One.


Furthermore, Zhongyin Joyful City, Linghua Noble Garden, Jiuxi Swan Castle, Zuoan Lido, Oulong Shengyuan, Hailiang Mansion, all of which are located in Confucius High-tech Zone, have been covered by the school district of the primary school of Chong Wen School.


With the development of cities and the implementation of China's two-child policy, more and more people are attaching importance to the division of school districts.


"In contrast with the relative concentration of residences in cities, the residences of Jining in the future are expected to be located all around the city and the traditional idea about school districts will be broken."


The marketing manager of a real-estate project said that in which school their kids will study in the future has become something of great concern to the people who plan to buy homes in the future.


Since its development in China, crowdfunding has shown a positive image to the public. Regions across China have started improving the environment around them through crowdfunding.


Not long ago, the parents in a residential quarter in Nan'an city launched a reading room for their kids through crowdfunding.


Because they wanted the kids to keep a good reading habit during the summer vacation, dropping cell phones and computers to return to the most original way in recreation and entertainment.


Such a reading room with love not only fostered children's reading habits, but also offered them a good place to go during the summer vacation.


In addition to reading rooms, crowdfunding has also brought some warmth to left-behind children, a grave problem facing China now.


Reportedly, there are more than 3,000 left-behind children in central and western Huangyan, most of whom are living with their elderly grandparents at home. Their parents have to work in other regions to earn money. Therefore, they may only see their parents once a year.


The lack of kinship and correct guidance frequently become an irretrievable pity for the kids during their growth.


It seems that launching reading rooms for kids, building homes for left-behind children, as well as other meaningful things alike can only be managed through crowdfunding.


"As an emerging industry in Internet finance, crowdfunding is gradually extending its advantages to all aspects. It has not only changed our living environment, but also silently changed our ideas."


Han Jianyu, general manager of Xf.cc, said that Xf.cc is engaged in the establishment of a crowdfunding system. A staff member of the company has also raised funds through crowdfunding on WeChat after his family members were attacked by a disease.


What I want to say here is that crowdfunding is not only an industry, but also a positive attitude and an accommodating spirit.


It is boundless. If you need and are brave enough to initiate crowdfunding, everything will become possible.

Guangdong's basic endowment insurance system for urban and rural residents is comprised of a primary endowment insurance fund and a personal account endowment insurance fund. The primary endowment insurance fund was jointly paid by governments at all levels.


In the meanwhile, the merchants' advice and suggestions on financial services and businesses were learned on the site, in a bid to improve services to better serve the public.


Carrying 216 passengers, an Airbus A330 double-channel wide-bodied aircraft took off from Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport on the noon of August 12.


The Chengdu-based airline will operate its Airbus A330 double-channel wide-bodied aircraft directly from Chengdu to Prague once every Tuesday and Friday.


It is expected that the opening of the regular direct route will further promote the bilateral economic and trade communications between the two regions and facilitate tourists from western China to Central and Eastern Europe.


Dolezal, a consul at the Czech Republic's consulate general in Chengdu, said that it will be more convenient for Sichuan residents to travel to the Czech Republic after the opening of the route. Thanks to that, they will be able to experience the beautiful sceneries in the Czech Republic sooner.


"The route will not only facilitate Sichuan tourists' travel to the Czech Republic, but also make it easier for the Czech people to visit Sichuan."


Dolezal said that the consulate general has already rolled out visa services and set up visa centers in many cities in southwestern China. "We suggest applicants apply for visas two weeks or 15 days in advance."


Excluding France, the Czech Republic has become the second most popular tourism destination in Europe to Chinese tourists in recent years.


Data released by the Czech Tourism Authority showed that the number of Chinese tourist arrivals to the Czech Republic has soared from 80,000 in 2010 to 250,000 in 2014.


Sources from Caracas said that Venezuela and Colombia on August 11 agreed on the reopening of their border one year after the closure of the border.


The decision was made after President Maduro of Venezuela and President Santos of Colombia's meeting.


According to BBC, only pedestrians will be allowed to cross in five places along the border during the first stage.


Maduro said after the meeting that he hoped the reopening of the border will help Venezuela resume its economic and trade communications with Colombia and improve the bilateral relations between the two countries.


Santos stressed that the border will be "gradually" opened. It will be a provisional opening as they learn and adjust their decisions every step of the way.


Colombia and Venezuela also agreed to work towards the full reopening of the border, saying they needed first to reach separate agreements on security, commerce and energy.


On August 19 last year, a group of Colombian paramilitaries shot a Venezuelan military patrol in riots with smugglers and wounded three soldiers and a civilian near the border.


Maduro then announced 60 days of martial law in five municipalities in the state of Tachira, which borders on Colombia, and the close of the border of the two countries.


Afterwards, the two sides held many talks in a bid to resolve the crises. They also recalled their ambassadors for discussions.


On September 21, 2015, the leaders of the two countries held a talk and agreed to gradually reopen their border for the first time, so as to normalize their relations.


We always think of beautiful sceneries, mysterious culture and honest villagers while mentioning ethnic villages. However, the impoverishment, sparseness and desolation behind them cannot be ignored.


The incorrect exploration models during the development of ethnic villages not only haven't changed the destiny of the villages, but also accelerated the disappearance of the villages and their culture.


Culture protection is not a static concept. For instance, Guangxi's Liu Sanjie will become meaningless if it is broken away from villages. No matter how excellent it is, the atmosphere of villages will be lacked when it is staged in other places.


Several Bombs Go off in Hua Hin and Some Other Regions in Thailand; Thai Military: Someone May Intend to Make a Mess


CNR reported in an evening news program that a sense of desolation and even tension shrouded the streets in Thailand on August 12, the country's Mother's Day, when it should be lively and peaceful.


From the evening of August 11 to the morning of August 12 (local time), eight bombs successively went off in Hua Hin, a renowned tourism attraction of Thailand, as well as some provinces in the south of the country.


The bomb in Hua Hin on the evening of August 11 seemed to be just the beginning of a series of bombs in the country.


In the past 24 hours, eight bomb attacks successively took place in five provinces in the south of Thailand, four in Hua Hin, two on Phuket Island, one in Surat Thani and one in Trang.


Two bombs exploded in front of two police stations in Surat Thani, respectively, after 8:00 on the morning of August 12, leaving one dead and many injured.


Another two explosions hit two police stations at roadsides on the famous Patong Beach on Phuket Island at 8:41.


It was the Mother's Day and the birthday of the queen of Thailand. However, many regions of the country were in a horrific atmosphere.


A staff member of Hitour, an overseas self-service tour service agency, has just paid a visit to one of the explosion sites.


The attack may have been small with a small harm according to the explosion site.


Disputes have been raised over the draft of Thailand's new constitution since it was unveiled, with focuses on the clauses on military power.


Supporters believed that the new constitution can heal Thailand's wound and promote the stabilization of the country.


Opponents believed that this is an "unfair referendum". Once the constitution is passed, the military will gain more power.


Especially, the new clauses introduced to the draft will weaken political parties' power but give more power to non-elected senators.


The Guardian said that the attacks seemingly targeting tourism attractions actually happened before the anniversary of the Bangkok blast taking place on August 17, 2015.


International observers said that the country's separatists are the biggest suspects, who were in military actions against Thai military in the three southernmost provinces.


To that end, some Chinese companies have been actively trying to set up laboratories and key labs with colleges and scientific research institutions in recent years.


"Encourage industrial, academic and research institutions to form an alliance can help integrate resources and speed up scientific researches."


After the launch ceremony, the international industry-college-research pharmaceutical alliance and the Wenzhou Medical University-New York University structural biological collaborative research center signed an agreement for the project of "internationally collaborative development of genetically engineered drugs".


US Sees 4th Amusement Park Accident in 5 Days: 3-year-old Boy Falls out of Roller Coaster


The accident took place at noon in Pittsburgh. The boy could still talk with his family members when he was sent to the hospital. Details about his injury are still unclear.


The roller coaster, which was built in 1938, does not include seat belts because it's not a stimulating one. The maximum height of the roller coaster is ten meters.


According to the park's rules, riders don't need to be accompanied by their parents if the amusement facilities are lower than 15 meters.


Pennsylvania is overhauling the 10,200 roller coasters in the state again after the accident.

Wang Xinliang noted that the elderly-cheating healthcare product companies usually adopt similar ways in cheating. They held lectures, offered presents on site and lured the elderly to buy their products.


"People who listen to the lectures can get 2.5kg eggs for free and those who bring another person to listen to the lectures can get 2.5kg more."


Wang Xinliang said that he has once encountered a case, in which the healthcare product sellers call the elderly either fathers or mothers on lecture sites, which made the elderly feel at home. However, it was actually an emotional marketing trick.


"We felt the treatment effect was good after taking the products. However, they were marked up to RMB 3,000 one week later. Then, we didn't buy them again."


Wang Xinliang said that according to the cases he has encountered in recent two years. The elderly were easy to be cheated. Most of the frauds took place when they buy drugs, healthcare products and wealth management products.


"Some elderly people bought a great number of healthcare products. Some who have high retirement pay didn't follow their kids' advice although they knew they had been cheated. Some even had conflicts with their family members."


According to the report of an economic comment program of CNR-2, online shopping is becoming the daily consumption means of many people. How many online shoppers will give a negative comment when shopping experience falls short of their expectations?


About 56.4% respondents of the survey said consumers' right to give negative comments is an objective reflection of the public monitoring system in the virtual online society, while 79.3% believed that it is necessary to launch relevant measures to protect consumers' right to give negative comments.


However, merchants' pressure should never be released through illegal means, while consumers should make good use of their rights.


If the comments of consumers are pertinent, you should accept such comments and improve your services.


If someone's comments are aimed to weaken your competitiveness on purpose. You can safeguard your rights according to the regulations of the anti-unfair competition law.


If their malicious slanders damage your business reputation and credits, you can lodge a civil litigation or report the case to relevant authorities.


According to relevant regulations in law, if merchants publicize your information to revenge you for your comments, they are actually infringing your reputation and information security rights. However, it will cost a lot of time and efforts for you to file a lawsuit against them.


E-commerce platforms have to give play to their monitoring role when relevant administrative departments are investigating and dealing with such cases.


On the other hand, those who publicize others' personal information should be held responsible through laws and regulations. Also, there should be a regulation on the punishment of online slanders.


MIIT Solicits Public Opinions to Raise Thresholds for New-energy Vehicle Makers and Products


Experts said that the opinion solicitation draft will raise the thresholds for new-energy vehicle makers and products, prevent low-level and repeated construction, standardize industrial orders, improve complete new-energy vehicles' quality and expand the application of advanced and applicable new-energy vehicles.


The implementation scope of new-energy vehicles was adjusted to pure electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell vehicles in the opinion solicitation draft.


In the meanwhile, the opinion solicitation draft has raised the thresholds for new-energy vehicle companies, including raising the requirements on companies' design and development abilities, production capacities, as well as their ability to guarantee after-sales services.


As for enhancement of the monitoring and control of product safety, the opinion solicitation draft also requires relevant departments to conduct full-life-circle and real-time monitoring of the operation status of all new-energy vehicles (including chassis).


Dong Yang said that we currently have 119 complete new-energy vehicle makers and about ten more qualified ones are expected to be launched within the next two years. Therefore, there will be little impact on the landscape of the new-energy vehicle industry.

The impossibility of the bus driver to communicate with the old lady in language forced him to escort her to the nearby Hongdao Border Police Substation.


At 10 o'clock that evening, the family members of the old lady were informed that she was in the Hongdao Police Substation after they called the police because she did not come back home, and then went to the substation to bring her home.


Through observation, the worker of the bus company found that the old lady dressed properly in clean clothes, and judged that she did not look like an old woman straying outside and coming from a humble background.


Since the worker could not get any valuable clues after one-hour communication, he had to escort the old lay to the nearby Hongdao Border Police Substation and hoped that the police will help the old lady find her family members.


Then, the police talked with the old lady with patience, but she still could not normally communicate with them.


At 10 o'clock that evening, Mr. Yang who lives on Haidian Island called the police and said that his 80-year-old mother got lost in the afternoon and there was no news about her till then.


When responding to the call, the police of the Hongdao Police Substation found that what Mr. Yang described about her mother fit in nicely with the characteristics of this lost old lay, and informed him of coming to the substation to make identification.


Then, Mr. Yang together with his nephew went to the police substation, and found that the old lady there was exactly his mother.


Mr. Yang thanked the police for their finding his mother in time and then brought her home after confirming that she's fit.


According to Mr. Yang, his 80-plus-year-old mother, who hails from Anhui province, told the family members that she wanted to go out for a walk this afternoon, but they did not think about that.


At about 7:00 pm, he hadn't seen his mother coming back home yet, so he requested his relatives and friends to search his mother around his home and the Haidian Island, but it did not work.


He also said that his mother has never taken a bus by herself, and guessed that it might be some good-hearted people helped her go onto the bus. Since she is suffered from minor senile dementia, she did not know where she had gone herself at that time.


After the motor tricycle slowly stopped, the traffic policeman went up to it and found that there were a total of 12 people in the vehicle including the driver.


After the driver got off the vehicle, he repeatedly emphasized that the brake did not work well. The policeman went up to check the brake and found it really did not work well. But the policeman criticized the driver on his behavior and detained the motor tricycle.


After inquiry, the policeman learned that all the 12 people in the vehicle were construction workers. The driver still picked up these workers to work under the condition that he knew the brake did not work well. This behavior was believed to be too dangerous and prone to cause casualty accidents in case of emergency.


The seventh Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set opens at Heihe, Heilongjiang province, on the evening of August 12.


This year's Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set will build a platform for the two countries to promote the alliance of their cultural industry, economy and trade as well as mutual development.


The year 2016 is the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Russian Good-Neighborly Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, and also is the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the Sino-Russian Strategic and Cooperative Partnership.


Under the vision of China's "Belt and Road" Initiative, the Chinese and Russian governments leverage the Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set as a platform to conduct a wide range of cooperation in all sectors.


As a large Sino-Russian cross-border culture, trade and exchange event, the Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set represents a platform where the Chinese and Russian people share the achievements of economic development and cultural prosperity, and boost their friendship and cooperation.


As an important carrier of the Sino-Russian friendship and cultural exchanges, the Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set has been successfully held for six years since its inception in 2010.


Fan Zhiguo, Vice Mayor of Heihe, told reporters that economy and trade have always been going ahead together with culture in the course of the development of Heihe.


At this year's Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set, we have invited overseas Chinese leaders and businessmen at home and abroad to Heihe for economic and trade matchmaking based on high-level visits and culture, literature and art group visits between the two countries, aiming to drive the development of bilateral economy and trade between China and Russia.


Fan Zhiguo said that the Sino-Russian Cultural Large Set provides us with a stage for culture, economy and trade to add radiance and beauty to each other.


The Chinese side will take advantage of "the cultural industry promotion engineering" and focus on their own strengths to enable "three strides", i.e. building a platform of cultural exchanges with Russia, opening cultural industry projects and integrating regional cultural resources.


The performances for the previous opening ceremonies of the event had been the focus of the 400,000 Chinese and Russian people concerned. This years' opening ceremony officially kicks off at 19:30 that day.


The performance comprises three chapters including The Dream of the Silk Road, The Interconnected Bridge, and The Flower of Friendship, highlighting the theme of "Cultural Trade, Cultural Exchanges, Economic and Trade Cooperation, Prosperity and Development".


The event also features six key activities including high-end exchange, exhibition, artistic performance, popular culture, sports culture and cultural tourism.


According to Taiwan's United Daily News reported on August 12, COSCO bought the largest stake of the Piraeus Port for US$311 million, and planned to increase its holding to 67 percent in the next five years.


Wan Min, Chairman of COSCO Shipping, said, "The purchasing plan of the Piraeus Port is one of the important milestones of the 'Belt and Road' initiative.


The growth and prosperity of this port can promote the economic development of both China and Greece, opening a new era for trade cooperation and cultural exchanges between the East and the West."

"With this port, Greece is well positioned to be China's gateway to Europe, allowing the two countries to benefit from it."


The Greek government signed an agreement this April to sell the managerial right of the Piraeus Port to COSCO, which became the second important state-owned assets privatization plan Greece has implemented since last year, according to the report.


The state-run COSCO will pay the Greek government annually for the managerial right of the Piraeus Port.


According to related specifications, there are two open excavation sections set at both the south and north ends of Yuhan Tunnel for the southern extension section of Shunhe Viaduct, and time-staggered construction measures are taken for the both open excavation sections to reduce the impact on the traffic, which will be open to traffic in succession.

In Mlandizi Town, Kibaha County, Coastal Province, Tanzania, Wang Shusheng from Hebei, China, is keeping busy. And a steel plant will be put into operation here in October.


"The annual demand for steel bars in Tanzania has reached 1.83 million tons, but the quality of locally produced steel bars cannot fulfill the requirements of large buildings such as high-rise buildings and bridges, so the country imports 70 percent of steel bars,"


This entrepreneur who has been dedicated to the steel industry for years pointed out the truth why Tanzania is a great appeal to him - the vast potential of the local market.


As with Wang Shusheng, an increasing number of Chinese entrepreneurs have turned their attention to Africa to seek opportunities.

CBC commentator confuses Michael Phelps with Ryan Lochte for whole race


An Olympics commentator working for Canadian broadcaster CBC suffered embarrassment on Thursday night when he confused Michael Phelps for rival Ryan Lochte.


Elliotte Friedman mixed the pair up for the duration of the 200m individual medley final, which Phelps won to claim his 22nd Olympic gold medal.


As Phelps streaked home for the win, Friedman believed him to be Lochte, Phelps' compatriot and long-term rival at the top of world swimming.


Friedman shouted: "Finally, he's going to do it!"


Ryan Lochte is going to beat Michael Phelps in this event!


Phelps might not even make the podium.


Phelps, however, won while Lochte trailed in fourth.


In the immediate moments after Phelps touched for gold, CBC's broadcast fell silent.


Friedman, admirably, admitted to his error immediately.


I apologise, I got my lanes mixed up.


Phelps with the gold," he said.


The Canadian commentator, whose professionalism has been widely praised after the mistake, owned up to his error once again in the hours after the event and apologised to viewers on Twitter.


I'm sorry everyone.


I blew it.


"No excuses," he wrote.


Phelps, meanwhile, broke a 2,168-year-old record for the most all-time individual Olympic titles with the victory.


The previous record was held by Leonidas of Rhoses, who is believed to have won more Olympic titles at the ancient games than anyone else.


Parking at the happiest place on Earth should be easier the find in the future.


Disneyland has released details of a long-proposed parking structure, a transportation hub and a new pedestrian bridge on the eastern end of the theme park resort.


The project, located east of the resort near the 5 Freeway, includes a 6,800-space parking structure and a transportation hub where buses, shuttles, taxis and other vehicles can drop off park visitors.


A pedestrian bridge over Harbor Boulevard connects the resort to the parking structure and the transportation hub.


The structure, along with the 14-acre Star Wars Land expansion project under construction, is part of a $1-billion investment promised to the city of Anaheim in exchange for a 30-year exemption on an entertainment tax.


Construction of the project, dubbed the Eastern Gateway, will begin next year.


The parking structure will be built on Disney's Pumbaa parking lot, which has about 1,300 spaces.


The transportation hub will replace a commercial property that the theme park purchased in 2014.


The project is expected to open in 2018.


"The Eastern Gateway is part of our substantial investment in Anaheim, which will provide additional guest parking and help to alleviate congestion in the resort district as we continue to expand the Disneyland Resort," Disney spokeswoman Suzi Brown said.


Thailand Bomb Blasts At Tourist Hotspots Kill Four


A series of bomb blasts across five of Thailand's southern provinces targeted popular tourist destinations on Thursday and Friday, leaving four people dead and many more injured, after the country voted to approve a military-backed constitution.


Two explosions first hit the seaside resort of Hua Hin on Thursday night, before another blast struck on Friday morning.


The town is located some 200 kilometers south of Bangkok.


The first blast killed one Thai woman and injured 20 people, 10 of them foreigners, police said.


Authorities confirmed that other blasts had targeted the southern cities of Phuket, Trang and Surat Thani.


Two bombs exploded in the town of Patong in Phuket and two more in Phang Nga, another tourist region just north of Phuket.


A total of 11 bomb blasts struck the country over the last 24 hours.


The blasts were not linked to Islamic extremism but acts of local sabotage, Royal Thai Police official Col. Krisana Patanacharoen said on Friday.


"It's too soon to jump to any conclusion," he said.


But what we know for sure is that the incidents are not linked directly to any kinds of terrorism, in fact it's local sabotage and we are trying to identify those responsible behind the scenes.


Investigation officials collect evidence from the crime scene after a small bomb exploded in Hua Hin on August 12, 2016.


A string of bomb attacks targeting Thailand's crucial tourism industry have killed four people, officials said on August 12, sending authorities scrambling to identify a motive and find the perpetrators.


There are no conflicts in the country that may lead to terrorists being in the country.


"That's why we can say that these incidents are not terrorist attacks," he continued.


No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack and authorities have not accused any particular group, but the explosions occurred in the same week that Thai voters approved a new constitution.


The three southern provinces of Hua Hin, Phuket and Phang Nga all rejected the military-backed referendum, and the Muslim-majority southeastern provinces of Thailand have faced an insurgency that has left more than 6,500 people dead since 2004.


The blasts came on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sirikit, a public holiday in the country.


Hua Hin hosts the Klai Kangwon royal palace, or "Far From Worries Palace," where the country's monarchy have often stayed.

Signs of Trouble in Ukraine Prompt Question: What's Vladimir Putin Up To?


It's difficult to judge the truth of these claims.


Ukraine denies them, and both the United States and the European Union say Russia has provided no evidence.


An open-source analysis group, the Digital Forensic Research Lab, found some indications of a firefight on Saturday, but little to back up Moscow's grander claims.


Russia has been known to distort or misstate events to serve political ends, particularly within the fog of Ukraine's still-ongoing conflict.


That doesn't mean that Russia's claims are all false.


Ukrainian militias last year sabotaged electricity pylons that power Crimea, and some of them are involved in criminal activity and human rights violations.


An attempted attack in Crimea is not out of the question, though there is little reason to suspect the Ukrainian government would sponsor such a plot.


Whatever happened, images found by open-source analysts suggest that Russia has been escalating its military presence in Crimea since at least Saturday - before the supposed attack occurred.


These show convoys of heavy weapons moving on the peninsula, including missile systems intended for coastal defense.


A disturbingly familiar Russian escalation


Some reports indicate that Russia's troops in Crimea were already scheduled for a new rotation about now, which would help explain the activity, though it would be quite a coincidence that this just happened to fall during some of the highest tensions since the 2014 annexation.


Whatever transpired over the weekend, Mr. Putin has unquestionably escalated in his language toward Ukraine, choosing to use this episode - however real it was - for some larger aim.


Analysts have pointed out disturbing parallels with how Russia behaved just before previous military actions against Ukraine.


In February 2014, similar speeches and military maneuvers provided cover for Crimean volunteer militias to seize the peninsula, then still controlled by Ukraine, only to reveal they were in fact Russian special forces launching a military occupation.


That August, as Russian-backed separatists lost ground in eastern Ukraine, Mr. Putin stationed troops along the border, warning they might be necessary to "protect" ethnic Russian civilians in Ukraine who he said were under attack.


He orchestrated an aid convoy into the region that, according to NATO, was mere cover for a Russian invasion force.


What is Mr. Putin planning in Crimea?


Some have wondered whether Moscow might be plotting another intervention.


Fighting has increased in eastern Ukraine, as it did before the August 2014 incursion.


But that seeming parallel may be the point, meant to create fear of military action - rather than actual action - that will give Mr. Putin leverage with Ukraine and with Western countries.


Mark Galeotti, a New York University professor who studies Russia, pointed out that Crimea would make little sense as a staging ground for military action against eastern Ukraine, which borders mainland Russia but not Crimea, and that the rest of the country is better defended.


"It's highly unlikely that the Russians are truly planning some major offensive," Mr. Galeotti said.


Rather, "We're looking at a classic Russian strategy of building up tension."


International peace talks over Ukraine, once the mechanism by which Mr. Putin forced contact with Western leaders who had shunned him over annexing Crimea, have become increasingly regarded as fruitless and irrelevant.


By dangling the threat of renewed conflict, Mr. Putin gives the talks a new purpose: to coax him back from the brink.


"It's a standard Putin tactic - he wants to try to go there from a position of strength," Mr. Galeotti said of the next peace talks, planned for early September.


"And the only real strength is to say, "I could make things much, much worse if I wanted to." "


Positioning for a bargain with the West


Mr. Putin also said this week that it made little sense to continue negotiations amid the Crimea tensions, forcing the other parties to persuade him to come back to the table - and putting himself at the center of the process.


What does this actually get him?


For one, it allows Russia to continue asserting itself as a global power, even though its economy is smaller than Australia's.


For another, it positions Moscow as having a veto over Ukraine's sovereignty, keeping the country within some degree of Russian control.


It may also serve Mr. Putin's long-held hopes of a grand bargain with the United States that would settle their disputes over Ukraine and Syria - on terms favorable to Moscow, naturally - as well as ending Western sanctions against Russia.


Mr. Putin has repeatedly hinted at this goal since his nation's economy began collapsing in late 2014, due mostly to the declining value of its oil and gas exports.


Since intervening in Syria last fall, he has repeatedly invited Western powers to join him in a grand coalition to fight extremists.


But Russian leaders may believe that they would need to secure such a deal before January, when President Obama will leave office.


Russian officials tend to view Hillary Clinton as the likely successor and as more hostile to Moscow.


Donald J. Trump, while conspicuously friendly toward Russia, is still seen as unpredictable.


But Mr. Obama is seen as "looking for resolutions, not conflicts," Mr. Galeotti said.


So there is a sense that there's a closing window of opportunity to get something done quickly.


In the meantime, should no grand bargain come, Mr. Putin appears happy to keep Russia's weaker neighbor guessing about what's coming next.


An earlier version of this article misstated the year that Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.


It was 2014, not 2013.


With Congress Deadlocked, White House Diverts Funds to Fight Zika


The Obama administration on Thursday said it was shifting $81 million away from biomedical research and antipoverty and health care programs to pay for the development of a Zika vaccine, resorting to extraordinary measures because Congress has failed to approve new funding to combat the virus.


Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, told members of Congress in a letter that without the diverted funds, the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority would run out of money to confront the mosquito-borne illness by the end of the month.


That would force the development of a vaccine to stop at a critical time, as locally acquired cases of Zika infection increase in Miami.


As of last week, 7,350 cases of Zika had been reported in the United States, most in Puerto Rico, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.


Ms. Burwell said that 15 infants had been born with Zika-related birth defects.


The virus can cause abnormal brain development and other serious defects in children born to infected mothers.


The local spread of the illness in the continental United States, with the first cases reported late last month, has raised the political stakes surrounding the federal government's response.


Hillary Clinton on Tuesday made a campaign stop in Wynwood, the Miami neighborhood that has had a rash of locally transmitted Zika cases, and pressed Congress to return from its five-week break to approve emergency funding to fight the virus.


President Obama and congressional Republicans have been at odds for most of the year over Zika.


In February, Mr. Obama requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding.


Republicans balked, demanding a more detailed accounting of where the money would go.


Lawmakers have feuded for months over how much money should be earmarked and how it should be spent.


Last month, Democrats blocked consideration of a Republican measure that would have allocated $1.1 billion to fight Zika but included provisions that would have banned funding for Planned Parenthood to provide contraception related to the virus, which can be sexually transmitted.


The deadlock prompted the White House in April to shift $589 million in Ebola funding to the Zika effort, about two-thirds of it designated for domestic use.


On Thursday, Ms. Burwell said that her department had used most of that money, and that it would be gone by the end of August.


"The failure to pass a Zika emergency supplemental has forced the administration to choose between delaying critical vaccine development work and raiding other worthy government programs to temporarily avoid these delays," Ms. Burwell wrote.


Democrats seized on the announcement to berate Republicans for failing to provide additional money for Zika.


At a news conference, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, called on Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, to bring Congress back to advance such a measure.


"Every possible option is being exhausted, and now we're going into the National Institutes of Health, which is supposed to be a priority," Ms. Pelosi said.


Aides to Mr. Ryan said that shifting the funds was a long-overdue step that the Obama administration had delayed to squeeze maximum political advantage out of the Zika issue.


The National Institutes of Health announced last week that it had begun clinical trials of a Zika vaccine on 80 human subjects, and hoped to begin a second phase in "Zika-endemic countries" in early 2017.


But without more funding now, officials said Thursday, the research would halt in its tracks.


Ms. Burwell said she would transfer to the Zika efforts $34 million in N.I.H. funds that had been designated to find treatments for other diseases, including cancer and diabetes.


Another $47 million will be transferred to the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which supports the development of drugs and vaccines to respond to public health emergencies.


That money will come out of a variety of accounts, including $19 million from a program that supplies heating oil subsidies for low-income families and $4 million from substance abuse programs such as those for opioid addiction.


Even then, Ms. Burwell said, the additional money will last only through next month, at which point agencies would have to "severely curtail many of their critical efforts" against Zika without action from Congress.


In the last four months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spent $60 million to help states protect pregnant women, $25 million to strengthen their Zika preparedness and response plans, and $16 million to help them create data-collection systems to quickly detect microcephaly and other Zika-related syndromes.


Thai Leader Links Attacks on Tourist Sites to Constitution Change


The head of the Thai junta urged his countrymen on Friday to have patience while investigators determine who was behind a wave of deadly bombings in Thailand this week.


Gen. Prayuth Chan-ocha, the junta chief and prime minister, hinted that the perpetrators were "bad people" opposed to a new Constitution that was approved by voters on Sunday in a nationwide referendum.


"There are still bad people, and they have been acting since before the referendum," he said in an address to the nation.


The bombings in five provinces on Thursday and Friday, including in Phuket and Hua Hin, areas popular with tourists, killed four people and injured dozens.


The authorities said arson attacks elsewhere in the country appeared to be related.


Analysts said the bombings did not appear to be aimed at killing many people, but rather at damaging the tourism industry, one of the few bright spots in Thailand's economy.


At least nine foreign visitors were injured in Hua Hin.


"Whatever the motives are, the explosions and arson attacks undermine the junta's claim that the post-referendum situation would be stable," said Sunai Phasuk, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.


These attacks create effects that discredit the authorities, terrorize the public and harm the tourism-based economy.


Photo Thai rescue workers treated a victim injured by a bomb that exploded in Hua Hin on Friday.


The police said they did not believe that the bombings were tied to international terrorism or to a long-running Islamic insurgency in southern Thailand.


They have portrayed the attacks as "local sabotage," not terrorism.


The timing and location of the attacks carried strong political symbolism.


The bombings occurred as people prepared to celebrate the birthday of Queen Sirikit on Friday, which is considered Mother's Day in Thailand.


Four bombs struck the royal residential town of Hua Hin, about 125 miles from Bangkok, where most injuries occurred.


The military-drafted Constitution will diminish the influence of political parties and give greater power to the military even after it returns the government to civilian control.


The junta helped ensure its victory by preventing opponents from campaigning against it.


Murray Hiebert, an expert on Southeast Asia at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, noted the military's suspicion that the attacks were carried out by people disgruntled over the vote.


The bombings were "clearly coordinated but obviously intended to create fear and anxiety rather than massive damage and deaths and injuries," he said.


Last year, a bombing at the popular Erewan shrine in Bangkok killed 20 people, most of them tourists from China.


Thai officials attributed the bombing to Uighur militants angry over the return of more than 100 Uighurs to China.


General Prayuth, who has led the junta since a 2014 coup ousted a civilian government, said this week's bombings "hurt the hearts" of Thai people.


"Why now, when the country is getting better, the economy is getting better, and tourism is getting better?" he said.


We have to ask why, and who did it.


Golden Reaction: What Simone Manuel's Historic Moment Looked Like


Just coming into this race tonight, I kind of tried to take the weight of the black community off my shoulders, which is something I carry with me just being in this position.


But I do hope that it kind of goes away.


I'm super glad with the fact I can be an inspiration to others and hopefully diversify the sport.


But at the same time I would like there to be a day where there are more of us and it's not Simone, the black swimmer, because the title black swimmer makes it seem like I'm not supposed to be able to win a gold medal or I'm not supposed to be able to break records.


That's not true because I work just as hard as anybody else and I love the sport and I want to win just like everybody else.


The Fight to Protect L.G.B.T. Students in Colombia


Two years ago, 16-year-old Sergio Urrego jumped to his death from a shopping center in Bogotá, leaving as his suicide note a Facebook post quoting Pink Floyd's "Goodbye Cruel World."


His death was the genesis of a controversy that roiled Colombia this week, as the effort to expand L.G.B.T. rights was drawn into a broader political fight that has polarized the nation.


After his death, Mr. Urrego's mother, Alba Reyes, sued school officials, faulting them for ostracizing her only son after discovering that he and a classmate had an intimate relationship.


A year later, Colombia's highest court issued a sweeping ruling in her favor, calling on schools nationwide to develop clearer policies to prevent discrimination.


The decision was part of a string of legal victories for Colombia's gay rights movement, which earlier this year celebrated a decision that legalized same-sex marriage.


This week, though, their fight for equality hit an obstacle as Gina Parody, the minister of education - who is openly gay - became the flashpoint of a scandal over the implementation of the ruling.


The fracas started when sexually explicit content from a pornographic magazine began circulating on social media, peddled by people who claimed it was part of a guidance manual issued by the education ministry.


Ms. Parody quickly debunked that.


While the ministry offered guidance to schools on issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity in an effort to help them heed the ruling, it has not sought to impose standardized rules.


"What we want is for schools to have the tools to resolve conflicts," Ms. Parody said in an interview on Thursday.


The dispute opened a new front in a national debate over the future of a country torn over peace negotiations between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or the FARC, a guerrilla group.


A coalition of politicians opposed to the government and leaders of the Catholic Church mobilized with extraordinary speed, accusing the government of President Juan Manuel Santos of promoting same-sex unions and gender fluidity.


To complicate matters, the government delegation negotiating with the FARC in Havana recently reached an accord on gender and L.G.B.T. equality that calls on the government to adopt more inclusive policies.


Critics of the government - and the peace talks - pounced on Ms. Parody, a 42-year-old rising star in Colombian politics.


They displayed crude posters at rallies and some threatened violence against her and her partner, Cecilia Álvarez-Correa Glen, the former commerce minister.


Ms. Parody remained admirably stoic throughout the bruising week as she sought to set the record straight and recast the debate on constructive terms.


"Part of what has kept me standing and clear-headed is knowing that there are kids out there who are in the process of coming out of the closet," she said.


This is a tough stage and a very lonely time.


She also drew a connection between the peace process and the debate over L.G.B.T. students.


As Colombians continue to weigh the merits of a deal with the FARC, which would mark an seismic turning point for the country, they must consider the roots of the conflict, she said.


"Is a peaceful country one that promotes inclusion or exclusion; is it one in which everyone has equal opportunities?" she said.


While she takes no pleasure in having been the target of insults and harassment this week, she is glad that in today's Colombia, gay students can look up to her and consider that they, too, can aspire to serve as a minister one day.


"To me, it's critical that they can be at ease and that they realize that they can reach their full potential," Ms. Parody said.


We can't wait for a new suicide to start changing.


Keeping the Vote Cybersafe - The New York Times


In "U.S. Seeking Ways to Keep Hackers Out of Ballot Box" (news article, Aug.


4), Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says the Obama administration is discussing giving extra protections to the nation's electoral system.


This change may be necessary and should be considered immediately.


The diverse nature of the cyberthreat, and the recent revelation that outside actors, possibly nation-states, have an increased interest in influencing our elections, make it imperative that the federal government give additional attention to securing our electoral system and possibly deem it part of our nation's critical infrastructure.


Without delay, Mr. Johnson should communicate with the thousands of jurisdictions in the country that help carry out elections and offer the Department of Homeland Security's assistance, expertise and guidance.


While the diverse and varied nature of our voting infrastructure confounds efforts to secure it, this tells us that the process should begin as soon as possible.

The UK government recently announced suddenly the suspension of the project of Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station in the UK in partnership with China and France, attracting a wide spread attention at home and abroad.


A UK government spokesman recently said that the deferral of the project does not mean the UK has chilled its enthusiasm for China, as China and the UK are still cooperating in a wide range of sectors and the UK will continue to seek to maintain the strong partnership with China.


Some experts pointed out that China's nuclear power leads the world in technical level, safety performance, operating experience and all other aspects, as well as has relatively low costs.


Therefore, although "Nuclear Power Going Global" will experience trials and tribulations in a given period, the trend of mutually beneficial cooperation between the parties will not be changed in the context of huge win-win potential.


But these words clearly do not hold true for what the UK did in the project of Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station.


Once the project is completed, it will meet 7 percent of the UK's power demands and help reduce 9 million tons of carbon dioxide annually in the operation period of 60 years.


Analysts generally believe that complicated factors in the UK such as exposed economic risks, increasing disputes among domestic politics, cumbersome subsequent procedures after Brexit, and increasing future uncertainties all impede its nuclear power projects.


"Currently, since property prices in the UK are falling and outflow of capital starts occurring, keeping domestic economy and market system stable has been the top priority of the UK's new government.


Meanwhile, after the approval of Brexit vote, the UK also needs to face a number of Brexit procedures in the coming days and straighten out its relationship with EU countries like France again.


Xu Mingqi said that though the UK's new government shows apparent eagerness to "differentiate from" the previous government, it does not deny the positive significance of nuclear power projects.


Over the past two decades, however, the UK has seen the stagnation of the development of its nuclear power, and a majority of its existing 15 nuclear power stations have reached their design lifetime.


According to the prediction of the UK's Energy White Paper, there will be only one nuclear power station still in service in the UK by 2025, leading to major gaps in electric power supply.


For this reason, the parties express their common concerns about the suspension of this project benefiting the public welfare by the UK government.


In the view of Scuoler, where it is in the interests of the both countries, China can play a key role in helping the UK reconstructing infrastructures.


Liu Xiaoming said that we look forward to successfully starting and implementing the project as early as possible, providing the UK with safe, reliable and sustainable energy.


According to insiders, projects of nuclear power stations are instrumental in the reduction of electricity cost for the British public, while at the same time driving local economy and employment.


So, if the UK's new government makes a final decision from the prospective of maximizing its people's welfare, nuclear power projects will not see a gloomy outlook.


The UK side can address energy demand gap, and the sides of both China and France can find the market for their own advantageous technologies and products in the field of nuclear power, benefiting more people."


In spite of the increasing uncertainty of the Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station project, there is no doubt about China's high-level and sophisticated experience in nuclear power technology.


Taking China's "Hualong 1" that will enter the British nuclear power market as scheduled as an example, it incorporates the advantages of other advanced nuclear power technologies and drew previous experience in design.


For instance, China has designed the "passive residual heat removal system at the secondary side of vapor generator" based on problems reflected in Japan's Fukushima nuclear accident, which can remove the heat from reactor cores in time, avoiding the meltdown of reactor cores.


Liu Xiaoming said that China has been keeping a good track record and safety level during the development of nuclear power for more than 30 years, and international institutions set a high value on the achievements it has made in nuclear power development and regulatory.


It is now an important historic moment for the relationship between China and the UK, so mutual respect and trust are more valuable than ever.


The Chinese side hoped that the UK government continues to support the Hinkley Point Nuclear Power Station project, and makes a decision as early as possible to ensure the successful implementation of the project.


In the opinion of He Weiwen, Co-chair of the Sino-America-Europe Economic Strategy Research Center, the China Association of International Trade (CAIT), since there is limited time for the British side to make the decision, the both parties need more substantive communications and dialogues.


"Following the change of president of Argentina, the China-Argentina nuclear power station project was also laid aside temporarily, but it has now been clearly scheduled to begin construction in the first quarter of next year."

The 9th China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week will officially enter the extended period from August 8 and host 70 activities throughout the year.


In the previous opening period, government officials, presidents from colleges and universities, experts and scholars alike from China and 10 ASEAN countries conducted effective exchanges in plans for educational development.


In addition, it is worth noting that the 2nd "China-ASEAN Education Ministers Round Table" brings together all the education ministers from the 11 countries for a second time six years later since the inception of China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week.


This year marks the "China-ASEAN Education Exchange Year" and also is the 25th anniversary of the dialogue relationship established between China and ASEAN.


In recent years, China and ASEAN countries has been increasingly deepening exchanges and cooperation in all domains, and constantly launched highlights in educational cooperation.


It is understood that, during the education exchange Week held by the two parties for years in a row, nearly 800 cooperation agreements were signed, continuously enabling win-win cooperation in people-to-people exchange.


In this exchange year, as flagship programs of the Education Year, the 9th China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week and the 2nd China-ASEAN Education Ministers Round Table were of particular concern.


And, "China-ASEAN Qingzhen Vocational Education Center" and "China-ASEAN Rail Transit Education and Training Alliance" were inaugurated as well.


The "China-ASEAN Education Exchange Year" that has been held for years running provides a goal of closer regional education cooperation for building the "China-ASEAN Community of Shared Future".


"The China-ASEAN Education Exchange Week plays an irreplaceable role in deepening human-oriented exchange between the two parties and erecting the "Bridge of Soul, Bridge of Friendship, Bridge of Understanding."


Today, the attention paid by people to tumors is increasing rapidly, which in a large part might be linked to cancer incidence at a high level in recent years.


According to reports about cancer in 2012, there were about 3.37 million new cancer cases and some 2.11 million death cases in China every year.


Cancer has been the No.1 cause of death in China, with the death toll accounting for one quarter of the global death toll due to cancer.


Due to its uncontrolled growth and proliferation, caner can affect nearly every part of human body.


Generally speaking, any part of human body might suffer from cancer, and some kinds of cancers will also be transferred to other part of the body.


Cancer is a genetic disease, but studies found that only a small number of cancers are genetic.


Many factors can affect the occurrence and development of cancers, among which environmental factors are on top of the list and can be changed.


Environmental factors include smoking, infectious factors, radiation, pollution as well as foods, nutrition, and physical activities, etc.


After Mr. Li was sent to the hospital, the doctor told his family members that he was in a serious situation because he was in a hyperosmolar coma caused by severe dehydration as a result of diarrhea, and he might die if sent here a few minutes later.


According to statistics, the symptom of diarrhea might be found in some 20% of diabetics, particularly previously untreated patients or those whose blood glucose has not been controlled properly.


For some diabetics, chronic diarrhea might even the primary disease symptom, which is so deceptive and then leads to missed diagnosis and misdiagnose.


Diarrhea in the wake of dyspepsia can lead to anorexia and nausea, and taking digestives can help the illness take a turn for a better way; for bacterial diarrhea, the disease generally comes in suddenly and several times a day, accompanying with the feeling of abdominal pain, but it can get recovery after a short-term treatment.


And for diabetic diarrhea, it is mostly expressed in refractory diarrhea without obvious abdominal pain and with assayed excrements that do not accompany infection in most cases, but the number of diarrhea is significantly increased, up to 20-plus times a day.


Additionally, when some hypoglycemic drugs such as melbine (DMBG) or α-glucosidase inhibitor are taken at very onset, patients might happen to side effects like abdominal distension, abdominal pain and diarrhea.


This is because stress hyperglycemia together with hypoglycemia condition might occur after diarrhea in case of inflammation.


Moreover, human body is in a stress situation due to diarrhea, releasing multiple hormones. While its confrontation with diarrhea, human body will also suffer from much blood glucose that outflows, which might cause ketoacidosis in severe cases.


Therefore, in addition to etiological treatment in hospital, diabetics should also pay attention to the following aspects after diarrhea.


Diabetics suffering from acute diarrhea must prevent dehydration first, so it is necessary to drink more water, which naturally helps them with more urination, allowing for draining unnecessary blood glucose as well as acetone bodies.


However, it is best not to have drinks containing caffeine because caffeine can stimulate gastrointestinal motility and then aggravate diarrhea.


For diabetics, blood glucose regulation will be out of balance in case of acute diarrhea, so they must closely observe the changes of blood glucose. It is best to measure blood glucose every 3 to 4 hours.


The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved field tests of genetically altered mosquitoes to be conducted in Florida in the southeast of the United States.


This kind of genetically altered mosquito can help control the transmission of mosquito-borne infectious diseases such as Zika, Dengue fever and Chikungunya fever.


According to a preliminary environmental assessment report released by the FDA in March, this kind of mosquito will not significantly affect the environment.


The report also noted that, however, this did not mean this kind of mosquito can be used for commercial purpose.


Oxitec also must follow other regulations specified by the federal, state and local governments, and work together with its local partner Florida Keys Mosquito Control District to determine the time of conducting field tests.


Tests conducted in Brazil, Panama and Cayman Islands showed that this kind of mosquito can reduce the number of mosquitoes in test areas by more than 90%.


There are also controversies about utilizing transgenic technology to "eliminate mosquitoes with mosquitoes", among which some experts believed that this will bring unknown influence to environment.

Fortunately, a good-hearted passerby found that. Then, he continuously shouted at the truck driver, and drove his car to overtake the truck and forced it to stop, helping the man be off the hook.


The good-hearted passerby is called Yang Dong (assumed name), and his automobile data recorder shot the breathtaking scene.


The video data showed that, at about 18:14 on the day of the incident, Yang Dong driving his car passed by the incident road section, and a middle-aged man on a bike came out of the roadside of the rear of the truck all of a sudden.


When the truck driver was getting ready to turn the truck to the left and directly ran down the man who was quickly pulled under the bottom of the truck.


However, at that time the truck driver looked at Yang Dong with a blank expression, and did not know what he meant, but got ready to continue to drive forward.


In such emergency, Yang Dong promptly pulled down his car window, shouting loudly at the truck driver, "There is someone under your truck, stop it right now!"


Just then, he drove his car fast to overtake the truck and got in the way to stop it.


Afterwards, the man crawled out from under the truck and stood up. After preliminary checkup, he just suffered from broken skin on his knees and there were no open wounds on other areas of his body.


The next day, he uploaded the driving video onto the Internet to remind drivers that they should pay attention to the condition under their car during driving, and many netizens gave a thumbs-up to his practice.


It is said that Steve is a graphic designer who is the very image of Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, from whom the biggest difference is that he has intact ears.

According to Sweden's Dagens Nyheter, identity theft has been one of the fastest-growing crimes in Sweden society.


Identity theft is a crime form of illegally obtaining other persons' identity information and leveraging it to pose as them for profit.


The survey data from Sifo shows that one quarter of the respondents said that they disclosed their personal information in email, SMS or other social media over the past 12 months.


The president of My Safety, a Sweden insurance company, pointed out that one reason of the high frequency of criminal cases of identity theft was that people are incautious when using personal information, allowing criminals to take advantage of loopholes.


It is reported that the Swedish police have invested massive resources in the fight against identity theft crimes at the beginning of this summer.


Only if the stolen identity is used for fraudulent activities, such as shopping in the name of another person online, it can constitute a criminal act.


There is a flourishing new housing rental market in cities across Sweden, Svenska Dagbladet recently reported.


The latest data showed that the waiting time for the availability of new rental housing was extended instead of shortened in almost a year.


In particular, the waiting time for the availability of housing in the center and outskirts of the capital Stockholm was extended for up to two years.


At present, the average waiting time for signing a new housing contract in Stockholm is a minimum of 16.5 years, while that in the outskirts of Stockholm is also more than 13 years.


According to head of marketing at Swedish Housing Authority, supply falls to meet the demand in Stockholm's first-hand housing rental market, the waiting time increases too fast, and the waiting time for the availability has hit an all-time high.


It is reported that although tens of thousands of first-hand houses have been delivered in Stockholm this year, the demands for first-hand housing rental are still on steady increase.


According to the data, the availability of first-hand houses (only including old houses, but excluding new house rental) in the first half of this year was only 2,006 units, and the number of people waiting for a first-hand contract has exceeded 540,000.


Svenska Dagbladet estimates that if the present pace is kept, it might take 130 years to get a rental house after application.


According to the data over the past 12 months, housing crisis is not just a phenomenon found in one city - the capital Stockholm, but in Goteborg and Malmo regions the waiting time for the availability of first-hand housing rental has also been extended in varying degrees.

Boy hurt on Pennsylvania roller coaster, week's third amusement park injury


A boy was injured when he fell from a roller coaster on Thursday and he was flown to a Pittsburgh hospital, emergency services and park officials said, in the third accident this week involving children hurt on U.S. amusement park rides.


The child, whose identity were not released, was flown to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh about 50 miles (80 km) west of Idlewild and SoakZone theme park in Ligonier, Pennsylvania, a spokeswoman for Westmoreland County Emergency Services said.


The 3-year-old boy, who was on the ride with his brother, was conscious while being treated on site, park spokesman Jeff Croushore said in an email


Croushore said the ride, known as Rollo Coaster, would be closed pending an investigation.


Idlewild requires children to be at least 3 feet (91 cm) tall to ride the roller coaster, and those shorter than 4 feet (122 cm) must be accompanied by an adult.


The ride was built in 1938, according to the park's website, and the state department of agriculture said it passed inspection in August.

Japanese PM Abe will not visit war-dead shrine on WW2 anniversary: Jiji


Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will not visit a controversial shrine for war dead in Tokyo on the anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War Two defeat, Jiji news agency has reported.


However, Abe plans to send a ritual offering to the Yasukuni Shrine to mark the anniversary on Monday, Jiji reported on Thursday.


The shrine honors 14 Japanese leaders convicted as war criminals and is seen in China and South Korea as a symbol of Tokyo's wartime militarism.


Abe has not visited the shrine in person since December 2013, which he said he did to show respect for those who died for their country.


Japan's new defense minister, Tomomi Inada, has declined to say whether she would visit the shrine because it was a matter of conscience.


Inada, a close ally of Abe and a supporter of revamping Japan's pacifist constitution, had made regular visits to Yasukuni in the past.


Masahiro Imamura, the minister for reconstruction of disaster-stricken areas, visited the shrine on Thursday and said he prayed for Japan's peace and prosperity, Kyodo news agency reported.

Although Brazil has no history of conflict with known militant groups, the government has said the Games made the country a more likely target, particularly because of participation by countries fighting Islamic State.


Its militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and a U.S.-led coalition has conducted air strikes against them.


The group has supporters worldwide who have carried out shootings and bombings of civilians.


New suspect in French priest killing formally charged


A man under arrest since Monday as part of the investigation into the killing of a French priest last month has been placed under formal investigation, a police source told Reuters on Friday.


The 21-year old suspect is under investigation for collaboration with terrorists and was planning attacks on people, the source said.


The man had been in telephone contact with Adel Kermiche and Abdel Malik Petitjean, who interrupted a church service in Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray, western France, on July 26, and slit the throat of 85-year-old Roman Catholic priest Father Jacques Hamel.


Both were shot dead by police.


The suspect had traveled from his home town near Toulouse to Saint-Etienne-du-Rouvray and spent the night there in the days before the attack, the source said.


The young man, who has no criminal record, has acknowledged having spent the night there but told investigators that he had left the next day because he did not had a good relationship with Kermiche and Petitjean, the source said.


Investigators are trying to establish whether Kermiche and Petitjean had accomplices in France and whether they had links with Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility for the attack.


A cousin of Petitjean was also placed in preventive detention at the end of last month.


Dorus de Vries undergoes medical ahead of Celtic move


Nottingham Forest goalkeeper Dorus de Vries has arrived in Glasgow as he looks to complete a move to Celtic.


De Vries was pictured entering Ross Hall Hospital ahead of a medical after the Hoops agreed terms with the Sky Bet Championship club.


Parkhead boss Brendan Rodgers is on the look-out for an experienced stopper to challenge current number one Craig Gordon.


But Rodgers has trust in 35-year-old de Vries having worked with the Dutchman during their spell together at Swansea.


He made 51 appearances for the Swans as they won promotion to the Premier League under Rodgers in 2011.


He quit the Welsh outfit that summer to join Wolves and has been at the City Ground since 2013.


He also has experience of playing in Scotland after spending a season with Dunfermline after signing back in 2006.


His East End Park stay ended in disappointment, however, as the Pars suffered the double agony of being relegated from the top-flight before losing out to Celtic in the final of the Scottish Cup.


The keeper has just one year left on his Forest contract and it has been reported Celtic will only have to pay a nominal fee to land his signature.


During Rio 2016 Olympic Games, security issue has been what people care about all the time, and people underwent another bomb fright before a men's basketball game this morning.


The Rio Olympics organizing committee confirms that the police working together with the military have detonated a suspicious knapsack found in the basketball stadium under control before the basketball game between Spain and Nigeria kicked off.


A security guard told Reuters that this suspicious knapsack was found after the end of the basketball game between Brazil and Croatia.


The police found the suspicious knapsack in a garbage can in a bathroom, according to the statement from a spokesman of the organizing committee.


Afterwards, the knapsack was carried away by a robot which then detonated it under the guidance of the police and military.


The statement also mentioned, "There is a tablet, a pair of socks and a jacket in the knapsack."


As the game between Spain and Nigeria kicked off, there were no spectators in the stadium, who were allowed to enter it after the security had been confirmed by the police.


The Spain's NBA superstar Pau Gasol said that the players got confused about the then condition for a time, "We heard the explosion, but did not know what happened on earth.


At the beginning, we just heard the explosion and then looked around, but found everything was OK."


There was also a suspicious bomb threat in the previous men's road cycling race at the Rio Olympics, but fortunately, the bomb-disposal squad controlled and detonated a suspicious package near the finishing line.


In scorching and sweltering summer, an increasing number of skin problems will be found in infants, which is closely linked to sweating more.


Temperature rise means the beginning of nightmare of many parents as their little baby starts suffering from itchy skin, accompanied with symptoms such as red rash and red spot, thus causing them to constantly scratch the skin and cry all the time at night.


Tan Xiaohua, a paediatrician from The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, observed that the proportion of little patients with skin diseases who seek for outpatient service will be increased every summer, and skin problems such as mosquito bites, eczema, reddish sudamen and diaper rash are more prominent.


In spite of various causes of formation, the symptoms are all much of a muchness, reflected in skin with red rashes and red spot as well as itchy skin.


As a matter of fact, the causes of these skin diseases are also quite similar, that is, little kids are not that "clean" due to too much sweat and saliva that but is not removed in time, so that the "covered" skin happens to diseases.


Podiatrist Tan Xiaohua noted that little kids have much more delicate skin as well as more heat production and sweat than adults.


Plus, the sweat gland of little kids is in the development, and the sweat gland and dermal gland of some children have not been balanced yet, leading to the inability to sweat.


"Some parents have a good habit by carrying a small towel with them and immediately wiping away the sweat on their kid once found."


"And for children often with wet clothes and sweat, skin rash will often be found on their body."


If the summer is too hot, babies will sweat too much, so parents can increase showering frequency for them and then put dry clothes on them.


For example, a shower for babies is taken every day at ordinary times, and now it can be increased to twice a day. However, flushing is just OK in the second bath, without the use of any bath supplies.


In addition, to prevent skin diseases in summer, anti-miliaria potion containing some herb ingredients like honeysuckle can be dripped into the bath water for babies, which can help disperse pore and perspire.


The above are essentials for parents to protect their kid's skin. For different skin diseases, parents can also adopt the following different treatment methods.


But keep in mind that if red rashes are accompanied with patches or repeatedly attack, it is recommended to see a doctor to check the possibility of other diseases.


"Keep any students from being deprived of education due to family financial difficulties" is our party and government's solemn promise.


The state places great emphasis on the efforts of funding the needy students by establishing a sound finance-aid system for college students covering multiple measures such as scholarship, loan, part-time jobs, allowance and tuition exemption


If students have questions, they can call the school in which they study first; if it doesn't work, they can dial the hotline set by relevant municipality or province and even the Ministry of Education.


She announced a flash marriage with the actor who worked with her ever on August 8, arousing great attention of society. Meanwhile, pictures of her smoking in the past were made public again, and even a startling inside story that she smokes a minimum of 40 cigarettes every day was disclosed.


Now, since Eikura Nana has just been married, many netizens believe that although she is now a grown woman who is not held liable for smoking, she had better quite smoking as soon as possible, or this will have a negative influence on her pregnancy in the future.


On August 12, the reporter learned from the Beijing Warning Center that Miyun District, Fangshan District and Pinggu District issued rainstorm red and orange warning signals in succession that day.


According to the Propaganda Department of the Miyun District Committee, Miyun District currently has shut down 34 tourism scenic spots and a submersible bridge in Daling Village, Beizhuang Town, has been destroyed.


At 10 am, August 12, Miyun District issued a rainstorm red warning signal and a geological disaster orange warning signal. And the rainstorm red warning signal was lifted at 2:30 pm.


It is estimated that there is still a thundershower or shower in Miyun District from the late afternoon to night that day, and mountainous areas and shallow mountainous areas will be at high risks of small and medium-sized river floods, mountain torrents, geological disaster and other secondary disasters arising from heavy rainfall.


Recently, Miyun District has dispatched 8,100 persons to be involved in the front line of flood prevention at district, town and village levels, and has evacuated 2,742 villagers across 164 villages to temporary shelters. The folk customs villages across the district stopped receiving tourists.


Additionally, the Pinggu District observatory issued an upgraded rainstorm orange warning signal at 12:50, August 12, and the Fangshan District observatory issued an upgraded rainstorm orange warning signal at 2:20 pm that day.


It is estimated that Fangshan District will still see a sustained rainfall and there will be geological disaster risks in mountainous areas and shallow mountainous areas.


And according to the Beijing Warning Center, an average precipitation measured by the rainfall monitoring stations across the city reached 20mm, with 13.7mm for urban area, from 6:00 am to 2:00 pm on August 12.


It is learned that at the time of the steam pipe break accident, more than 20 persons were working on thermal energy debugging on site.


Up to 3:30 am on the morning of August 12, the wounded persons were still in the ICU of Dangyang People's Hospital for emergency treatment.


Mr. Feng, a family member of the wounded person Luo Wen, said that 90% of his body has been scalded except hair and feet.


When Mr. Feng saw Luo Wen, he was unconscious due to serious injuries and doctors were saving his life.


It is understood that the five injured workers all suffer from scalding, some of whom are accompanied with injuries such as fracture.


Upon receipt of the accident report, the State Administration of Work Safety immediately dispatched a working group to rush to the scene of the accident, guiding and assisting local forces to make great efforts to carry out on-site rescue and accident handling.


Major leaders of the CPC Hubei Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government, together with leaders from the Hubei Provincial Safety Production Supervision Authority, also arrived on the scene to direct rescue operations after the accident.


According to the official, more than 17,700 people have been formally under arrest, over 11,500 people have been released, and more than 5,600 other people have been in custody.


It is learned that Turkey's rebel group attempted to launch a military coup on the evening of July 16 (local time).


The Turkish Government accused the opposition faction missionary Gulen of plotting an abortive coup attempt and requested the US to extradite him to Turkey.


Turkey's Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag said later that his government has made a second request for extradition of Gulen to the US.


From the evening of August 11 to the morning of August 12, there were 2 explosions on Phuket Island, 1 in Surat Thani and 1 in the south of Trang other than 4 in Hua Hin, Agence France Presse said.


It was previously reported that the first bomb exploded at local time 10 pm, August 11, but no one was injured.


The explosion of the second bomb killed one Thai woman and hurt several foreigners and Thai people.


"Among the wounded persons there are 3 seriously injured persons and 7 foreigners including 4 women and 3 men," said local police.


After the accident, the Thai police evacuated the public and visitors near the explosion sites and sent the wounded persons to local hospitals.


At present, the Thai police are investigating the motivation behind the explosion cases and what kind of bomb has been used.


As a renowned seashore tourism city in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, Thailand, Hua Hin attracts tons of domestic and foreign visitors every year.


Located about 200 kilometers away from the south of Bangkok, the city is a summer resort for the Thai royal household, where there are a number of beautiful beaches, national parks, historic sites and ruins of royal household.


On August 12, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that the risk for visitors, who go to Brazil to watch the 2016 Rio Olympic Games and Rio Paralympic Games, to suffer from Zika virus infection or transmission is not high.


If athletes and travelers have to go to Brazil, preventive measures can be taken to avoid two ways of Zika virus transmission: mosquito bites and sexual transmission.


As of August 10, 66 countries and regions have reported the evidence of the mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission since 2015.


Some countries or regions reported the decreased number of Zika virus infection cases, but the outbreak of Zika has not shown a declining trend in general according to the evidences obtained at the present stage.


The WHO stated that although there have been Zika virus cases imported from overseas to the Chinese mainland, no local cases of human infected by mosquitoes have been found.


On August 12, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said that although he abused Philip Goldberg, U.S. ambassador to the Philippines, he would not make an apology to Goldberg.


On August 12, the U.S. embassy in the Philippines said in a statement that the US side has noticed the reports about the criticism on Goldberg and these remarks were "inappropriate and unacceptable".


During the election campaign of president of the Philippines this April, Goldberg criticized Duterte on the issue of human rights, and the two continued to accuse each other with sharp speech conflicts later on.


On August 12 Beijing Time, the Spanish men's basketball team saw a glimmer of hope of reaching the next phase after a tough 96-87 victory over Nigeria.


Oguchi got 24 points, including 7 of 12 three-pointers and all the 3 free throws made but no scores from the field, Akognon contributed 12 points and 5 rebounds, and Ibekwe scored 11 points and 5 rebounds.


As a traditional European team, Spain was severely weakened by the absence of its star player Marc Gasol, which had it on the ropes and even made it hard to advance from the group.


Facing the weakest competitor Nigeria in the group, Spain also played very hard and scraped through the game at the eleventh hour.


Within the last 1 minute 20 seconds in this quarter, Nigeria failed to score again, and Rodriguez hit a three-pointer to help Spain take a 25-11 lead into the first-quarter break after 5 straight points.


When there were 3'54'' to go in the second quarter, Gasol made a driving layup to help Spain hold the lead at 40-27.


When there were 6'09'' left in this quarter, Llull hit two free throws for a 61-48 Spain lead, a two-digit advantage once again.


After Oguchi's three-pointer for Nigeria, Spain scored 4 straight points to extend its lead to 14.


However, within the last 4 minutes 49 seconds in this quarter, Spain stopped scoring. On the contrary, Nigeria ended this quarter with a wave of 13-0 including points in the paint and outside shots for a 66-65 lead, the first in the whole game.


In this wave of attacks, Nigeria hit two three-pointers and a foul outside the three-pointer line.


When the game came to the last 3'49'', Nigeria closed to 79-81 after Aminu added a layup.


After Oguchi's another three-pointer helped Nigeria reduce the score disparity to 1, Reyes and Gasol who scored 6 straight points with free throws gave Spain an 89-82 lead as there were 1'15'' to go.


On the evening of August 12 Beijing Time, Beijing Guoan lost 1-2 to Chongqing Lifan at home in the 22nd round of the Chinese Super League.


After a short-term adjustment courtside, Yu Dabao returned to the pitch, but his trouble hasn't been cleared up. So, he was substituted by Song Boxuan in the 76th minute due to his inability to hold on later in the game.


What is more, Yu Dabao could not move by himself and was stretchered off. After a 10-minute treatment courtside, he was directly sent into an emergency ambulance.


As far as the "national football squad" is concerned, the possible injury of Yu Dabao will certainly affect China's competition for the Russia 2018 Asian Qualifiers that will kick off half a month later.


In a postponed Chinese Super League game held in this midweek, in which Guoan was held to a 0-0 draw by Evergrande away from home, Yu Dabao's neck has been injured after a fierce fight for a ball against José Paulo Bezerra Maciel Júnior, both of whom fell over at that time.


Also in that game, Yu Hanchao's serious injury made people more anxious. According to a conservative estimation, he needs a four-month recovery period, that is, he will at least miss the first half of the games for the top 12 Chinese football teams.


If Yu Dabao's injury is serious, the front-field staffing of China's national football squad will be greatly affected.


However, engineers from University of California, Berkeley, have advanced this concept and developed a tiny wireless sensor that can be used to monitor the health condition inside human body.


The researchers introduced their invention on the Neuron published on August 3.


On top of that, these battery-free sensors can be used to stimulate nerve and muscle.


This will probably offer a way to treat disorders such as epilepsy or activate human immune system.


This device has been implanted into the muscle and peripheral nerve of rats, and uses ultrasound as energy source, which is also used to read collected data.


This sensor has been compressed to 1 mm3, called "Neural Dust" which includes a piezo-electric crystal.


The author of this paper explained that the crystal converts the vibration of ultrasound emitted outside the human body into electricity to drive a tiny transistor, which is directly attached to a nerve or muscle fibers, inside the device.


Voltage peak in fibers causes changes of current circuit and crystal vibration, so that ultrasonic receiver (which currently is still the source that sends ultrasonic vibration) can detect echo.


Now that ultrasonic technology is very common in hospitals and ultrasonic vibration can penetrate most parts of human body, it seems to be a natural choice.


Michael Maharbiz is an associate professor of electronic engineering and computer science at University of California, Berkeley.


As the co-corresponding author of the paper, he said in a statement, "I believe that the long-term prospect of neural dust is not restricted to nerve and brain, but much broader."


Maharbiz, together with his colleagues and Jose Carmena, a neuroscientist at University of California, Berkeley, led the research.


"It was utterly impossible to adopt internal telemetry technology in the past, because a tiny object cannot be put into a very deep place," explained he.


"Now, however, I can take a tiny object and put it near nerve, organ, digestive tract or muscle, which then can read data."


To test their device, Maharbiz and Caarmena utilized six 540ns ultrasonic pulse sent per 100ms to drive sensor.


But the researchers feel quite confident that they can also work in the brain and central nervous system.


"The neural dust project is created with a vision of describing next generation brain-machine exchange and interaction and making it a feasible clinic technology."


"If a paralyzed patient hopes to control a computer or a robot arm, you can implant this electrode into his/her brain, where it can continuously work for a lifetime."


Since the two lenses work simultaneously, they can distinguish obvious front and rear landscapes, producing a more shallow depth of field.


In the wake of Kumamoto earthquake, not only local Japanese territory was damaged, but the world's core industrial chain of digital cameras was also broken.


Following the Kumamoto earthquake, Sony's plant in Japan suffered from heavy losses, causing the world's digital camera industry to be now in a situation of either short supply or rise in price.


Almost all the sensors developed by Sony are used for cameras. The absence of sensor supply means no cameras to be produced.


Recently there was news that Sony has currently raised approximately US$3.6 billion in the form of issuance of stocks and bonds for the R&D and production of stack CMOS.


The supply of sensors is nearly made possible by Sony, regardless of digital cameras or mobile intelligent devices (I can't image what would the scientific academia looks like if there was no Sony).


Compared to sources about new recording format revealed, I would rather prefer to see Sony can recover its normal supply of sensors, because today's camera prices are extremely high.


Macy's to close 100 stores


Department store giant Macy's said on Thursday that it plans to close 100 stores, a dramatic step that is aimed at helping the chain get ahead of a potentially crippling problem: America, it says, has too many stores for the online shopping era.


Macy's regularly prunes its store portfolio, often moving to close several dozen underperforming stores right after the annual holiday rush.


But in dropping a summertime announcement that it will close 15 per cent of its 728 locations, the chain appears to be adopting a more aggressive posture than many of its retail industry counterparts about girding its fleet for the reality of a fast-changing shopping environment.


Pedestrians and shoppers pass in front of a Macy's store in New York.


The retail giant has said it plans to close 100 stores.


Macy's has plenty of reasons to scramble to make a change: Many of its stores are located in small, regional malls, the kind whose foot traffic has been especially hard-hit by the rise of e-commerce.


And the department store category has generally struggled as shoppers increasingly turn to off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx and fast-fashion players such as H&M to buy their clothes.


These factors, along with short-term hitches such as decreased spending by international tourists and unseasonable weather, have left Macy's in a rough patch that has stretched for more than a year.


On Thursday, the company said it saw a 2.6 per cent drop in comparable sales in the most recent quarter, a weak performance that was nonetheless an improvement over the dismal 6.1 per cent year-over-year decline it recorded in the previous quarter.


The retailer's revenue was $US5.87 billion ($A7.64 billion), down 3.9 per cent from the same period last year.


Macy's said the store closures would probably cost it about $US1 billion in annual sales.


And at one time, such a large batch of store closures might have been viewed as a retailer's concession of defeat.


Yet the company's stock soared 17 per cent on Thursday, a sign that investors view the move as a proactive measure that portends a stronger future for Macy's.


In some ways, it should not come as a surprise that Macy's is slashing stores.


Terry Lundgren, the retailer's chief executive, has said before that the chain simply had too many stores.


Executives have been saying for some time that they are embracing a strategy that puts particular emphasis on roughly 150 of their top-performing stores, trying to wring more sales out of those already-productive locations.


Jeff Gennette, the Macy's executive who has been appointed to replace Lundgren in 2017, said in a statement that nearly all of the stores the company plans to close are ones at which sales volume and profitability have been sliding.


"We recognise that these locations do not yield an adequate return on investment and often do not represent a customer shopping experience that reflects our aspirations for the Macy's brand," Gennette said.


The company said it would offer a list of the stores that will close at a later date.


Macy's said it is still finalising which stores it would shutter, and thus has not yet determined exactly how many jobs will be slashed.


The retailer will not pull out entirely of any of the top markets where it currently operates stores, but will look to close stores that are in weak locations.


The move is likely unwelcome news to mall operators, who count on big tenants like Macy's to attract and retain other smaller stores in their shopping centres.


Is your water bottle harbouring dangerous bacteria?


According to new research, drinking from refillable water bottle can be "many times worse than licking your dog's toy" in terms of the amount of bacteria it will bring you into contact with.


The website Treadmill Reviews commissioned EmLab P&K to test 12 water bottles of four different types - screw-top, slide-top, squeeze-top, and straw-top.


Each water bottle had been used by an athlete for a week without being washed.


Your refillable water bottle could be as dirty as a dog toy.


"Based on the 12 water bottles we tested, we found that reusable drinking containers may be crawling with an alarming number of viable bacteria cells: more than 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CFU/sq cm)," Treadmill Reviews said.


Slide-top were found to have the highest germ content, with more than 900,000 colony-forming units per square centimetre (CFU/sq) cm on average.


The bottles harboured gram-positive cocci, which can lead to skin infections, pneumonia, or blood poisoning.


Squeeze-top bottles were next-worse with 162,000 CFU/sq cm, and screw-top containers hosted just under 160,000 CFU/sq cm.


"Drinking from these bottles can still be worse than eating a meal from your pet's dish," the site added.


A far better picture emerged from tests on straw-top bottles, which were found to contain a fraction of the bacteria of other bottles - just 25 CFU/sq cm.


This may be because water drips to the bottom of the straw rather than sticking around to attract moisture-loving germs.


The germs that were present in the straw-top bottles were described as "mostly harmless."


"Based on our test results, we suggest opting for a straw-top bottle, both for the low prevalence of bacteria and the lack of harmful germs," the site said.


We also know that when it comes to water bottles and bacteria, stainless steel is a better choice than plastic.


Additionally, water bottles without crevices and tough-to-clean spots are less likely to host germs.


The site advises readers to wash water bottles after each use, ideally with a weak bleach solution.


Religion must either modernise or face obsolescence


In the United States the Democratic Party recently nominated Hillary Clinton as its presidential candidate.


If the results of the latest polls hold true at election time, America will swear in its first female president in January.


The previous week, across the pond, British Prime Minister Theresa May was negotiating the terms of Britain's exit from Europe with Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel.


Women living in Western society have been raised to believe they can be competent and successful in any professional role through education, ambition and hard work.


And young girls today can point at several living role models operating at the highest levels of leadership.


So is the long and hard battle for women's equality finally over?


Hillary Clinton is poised to become president of the United States, but in the religious sphere women's leadership is still a contentious issue.


Well, not entirely.


In the religious sphere women's leadership remains a contentious issue.


Last week Pope Francis announced a new commission to consider whether women should be made deacons in the Catholic Church.


The Anglican Church consecrated Libby Lane as its first female bishop in January 2015, but this was only after a failed attempt in 2012.


While the Jewish Reform movement has been ordaining female rabbis since the early 1970s, and the Conservative movement since the early 1980s, in Orthodox Judaism the notion of female rabbis is still hotly contested.


In November 2015, the Orthodox Rabbinical Council of America - in its third attempt to stem the growing tide of support for Orthodox women's rabbinical ordination - published a stern proclamation declaring the illegitimacy of female rabbis.


Not without irony, as Hillary Clinton wrapped up the democratic presidential nomination a group of leading American Orthodox rabbis opposed to women's ordination launched a series of "hearings" on this disputed subject.


Why is there such disparity between the secular realm and the sacred?


Orthodox Judaism, like most religions, seeks stability in what it considers enduring traditional values.


This finds expression in resisting the pressure to conform to a changing society.


Those who oppose women's ordination do so on the basis that it is not "traditional."


But the obsession with maintaining tradition in this way is not without a cost.


And the cost of such single-mindedness can paradoxically be the undermining of tradition itself by depriving the traditional community of the oxygen it needs to remain vibrant.


In The Guns of August, a military history of the First World War, Barbara Tuchman highlights the danger of prioritising tradition in what has become known as the "tragedy of the red trousers."


In the lead up to WWI, as warfare shifted from fighting at close quarters to heavier artillery fired from greater distance, it become advantageous to conceal soldiers for as long as possible.


The British and German armies reacted to this change by exchanging their bright coloured uniforms for drab greys and browns.


The French soldiers, however, still wore the same red caps and trousers, marking them out as easy targets.


The suggestion of the French war minister Adolphe Messimy that his armies do likewise was met with ridicule and resistance.


The red trousers represented army pride and prestige and military traditionalists were not prepared to give it up.


At a parliamentary hearing, a former war minister, Eugene Etienne, spoke for France.


"Eliminate the red trousers?" he cried.


Never!


"That blind and imbecile attachment to the most visible of all colours," wrote Messimy afterwards, "was to have cruel consequences."


Faith leaders grappling with women's inclusion in religious leadership roles are in danger of the same pitfall.


By focusing exclusively on "what is traditional" for their religion rather than asking the crucial question: "What change is necessary for religion to thrive?" they risk alienating 50 per cent of their flock.


They also deprive the entire community of the talent, skills and enthusiasm that women would otherwise contribute.


Insisting that men continue to wear the trousers when it comes to religion might be traditional, but, as the pantalon rouge debacle illustrates, it may not be worth the price.

Charlton Athletic fan 'can only get season ticket if he signs behavioural contract' and agrees not to badmouth club on social media


Whilst we recognise that everyone is entitled to their own personal opinion, it is not helpful when inflammatory comments are posted on such websites.


The fan, who works in administration, was then told he would have to pick the ticket up in person from former police Chief Inspector Cliff Eager, who joined the club last month after a 35-year career in the police force.


The letter continued: "I need to advise you that the granting of your season ticket will be 'conditioned' and subject to you signing an 'Agreed Behavioural Contract' (ABC) which will request that you refrain from posting derogatory or inflammatory comments regarding the Club or people representing the club in the future on any social media websites, or carrying out any other form of behaviour that could be deemed to be on an anti-social nature."


Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, the fan described how he called the club after paying for his season ticket, which never showed up and two days later the letter arrived in the post.


Yesterday, he went to the meeting with the club and said: "They told me I had been tweeting excessively and causing other people to tweet as well - which is ridiculous.'


A cycling holiday down the Dalmatian coast


What do you mean, luxury?


I rode my butt off back there," says Colleen, a former US naval commander who has just completed a 25-mile bike ride along the spine of some rugged Croatian island and left nothing out there but a bucketful of sweat and a salvo of salty naval expletives hurled at the hostile hills.


Some cyclists sing hymns or recite nursery rhymes as a climbing aid.


Colleen's friend Patty recommends The Little Engine That Could.


Others count revolutions or just suffer in silence, wondering what it takes to enter the trance-like state of which hardened cyclists speak.


Colleen swears, with more venom than variety.


Cycling a few yards ahead of her is like being pursued by Hugh Grant in the opening sequence of Four Weddings and a Funeral.


Her mission and mine is a week-long "luxury" boat and bike tour of Croatia's north Dalmatian coast and islands, organised by Freedom Treks.


Cycling at the height of summer in such a steeply pitched place as Croatia might not fit everyone's idea of luxury, but north Dalmatia is said to be an easier ride than south, our saddles are soft and when we filled in our booking forms in carefree and confident manner all those months ago there was a box we failed to tick that could have secured us the assistance of a battery-powered e-bike.


The luxury part of the deal is our floating home for the week, the brand new Melody.


At the end of the ride we can dump our bikes on the quay for our guides Ivan and Ivana to stow, and jump off the back of the boat into clear blue water without having to mix it with sea urchins, sharp rocks and other people on the hanky sized strips of pebbles that Croatians call a beach.


In late June the sea is a perfect temperature, all agree: cool enough to refresh, but not cold.


The Melody is stocked with masks and snorkels and a couple of kayaks should anyone feel energetic after a hard morning in the saddle.


Instead, most of us retreat to our air-conditioned cabins where Helena, the ship's masseuse - I'm not joking - will have made our beds, restocked our minibars and left a new box of chocs on the table.


Ivan says stretching is important after cycling, and we practise stretching out for the afternoon on our beds or a cushioned lounger on the top deck with Antonio the barman ever ready to administer one of his cocktails.


The Melody, at 42m long with 15 cabins and a crew of half a dozen shipmates, is no bulging superyacht but a stylish little cruiser.


She turns heads in a small island port among the fishing boats and flotilla holiday yachts, and we are proud to belong to her.


Colleen and Patty belong to a meetup.com group of friends from Washington DC: the Over 45 Sport and Socials, they call themselves.


Last year's barge and bike holiday in the Netherlands was such a success they decided to try something more adventurous and here they are in Croatia.


A rival chapel of their church is doing a boat and bike holiday in Provence, and every afternoon the ether thickens with a ping pong rally of competitive Facebook postings.


The adventure element of the holiday can be overstated, because our schedule is nothing if not regimented.


"Breakfast and dinner are at eight o'clock," Ivan announced to the new intake at the welcome briefing as we set sail from the beautiful old port of Trogir, near Split.


One ring of the ship's bell declares the buffet open and another at the end of the meal calls for silence and listen carefully to the next briefing.


"Good moaning!" is a cultural reference perhaps lost on all but the British contingent.


Who cares - the banter is well rehearsed and the jokes come thin and fast, while Ivana hands out sketch maps of the day's excursion and we all pretend to be horrified by the wiggles, contour shading and a profile with ups and downs on it, although anything else would be a surprise on a Croatian bike ride that starts and finishes at sea level.


"It's like a heart monitor," says Ivan.


Completely flat is not recommended.


Ivan delivers his briefing in parallel text, switching fluently between English and German.


Some weeks he has a dozen different nationalities to contend with, but we are an easy group - Swiss, German, American and British - which divides easily at mealtimes into two English speaking tables, one German.


On the road we are all friends.


Cycling breeds camaraderie, and the only competition is with the terrain, which is to say ourselves.


I can't remember a more harmonious and relaxed group dynamic.


We soon tune in to Ivan's wave length.


A stiff climb is an incline, not to be confused with an undulation, which is a good thing.


Hairpins are serpentines and straightforward means straight on: simple but not always easy.


Cycling instructions are always the same: "Single file, keep your distance, and it's not a race.


We meet on the quay at nine.


OK, five past - you're on holiday, I forgot.


Take lots of water.


From Trogir our cruise takes us northwards for two days through the Kornati archipelago, where we ride most of the length of Dugi Otok - Croatian for "long island" - and have our slumbers interrupted for a walk in the Telašćica Nature Park, to admire its high cliffs and a salt lake fed by sea water through an underground channel.


It is said to have rejuvenating power for all who swim in it.


If we paddle, will our legs feel younger and stronger?


At the small island of Molat we turn south again, hopping between mainland and nearby islands in seemingly haphazard fashion.


Most of our rides are on empty little roads through open country with big sea views and mixed veg: olive groves, vineyards, prickly herbal scrub; Mediterranean scents in the air and myriad butterflies on the wing.


While we roll along there is always a breeze but shade is at a premium when Ivan calls a halt, and small pools of it are the reward for early arrivals.


The Sport and Socials do a lot of group cycling at weekends and they know the etiquette, sending warnings up and down the line and leaving gaps so that motorists can overtake more safely.


"You were nearly a hood ornament there," one cyclist tells another, after a truck driver thought better of overtaking on a blind corner and hit the brakes hard.


Fortunately they worked.


Ivan divides us into three groups for the occasional short stretches of cycling on main roads, with Ivana at the very back to encourage and "scoop up," as Ivan puts it.


And if a main road must be crossed we all assemble, dismount and walk our bikes to the safety of the other side, as instructed and not before.


"Do you think Ivan realises he is not speaking to a group of children?" a Swiss cyclist asks, as we stand beside the road waiting for the signal to cross.


Our afternoons are not all devoted to idleness.


A city tour at Zadar reveals remains of a Roman forum and a sea organ which plays music like the moan of a caged sea monster, through pipes set in the stone fabric of the promenade and open to the water.


Zadar's famous sunset is perfectly timed between main course and pudding, and after dark we return to the sea organ and watch the play of wave-powered lights in a glass pavement - a dance floor, in fact.


When Melody sets sail for the lively resort of Biograd in the early morning, the organ's song is no more than a whisper.


Day five is entirely free of cycling.


A boat trip up the Krka river estuary to visit its waterfalls; an afternoon tour of Sibenik with its domed cathedral, a masterpiece of the Dalmatian Renaissance; and a twilight stroll on the peaceful island of Zlarin in search of its local speciality, coral - make for an interesting day.


Lourdes prepares for pilgrims in shadow of attacks


People gather during the annual Catholic pilgrimage at the sanctuary of Notre Dame de Lourdes.


French security forces are on high alert as thousands of Catholics converge on the shrine of Lourdes for an annual pilgrimage unfolding in the shadow of a string of terror attacks.


Each year, tens of thousands flock to the sanctuary in the foothills of the Pyrenees for the Feast of the Assumption on August 15, marking the ascent of the Virgin Mary into Heaven.


This year's pilgrimage comes as Catholics reel from the killing of an elderly French priest on July 26 by two Islamist extremists, who stormed his church in northern France during Mass and slit his throat.


Jacques Hamel's murder came under two weeks after a Tunisian -- said by investigators to have become radicalised by online jihadist videos -- ploughed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in the Riviera city of Nice, killing 85 people.


Many in France are now leery about attending public gatherings after three large-scale attacks in 18 months.


With tourist arrivals in the country plummeting, authorities had worried that the number of visitors to this year's pilgrimage would be sharply down.


But fears of mass cancellations have failed to materialise -- and some organisers say there has even been a last-minute surge.


Around 25,000 faithful are expected, including mass groups from Italy and Belgium and a delegation of around 200 members of the Eastern Orthodox branch of Christianity.


Many pilgrims say they will not be cowed.


"We're not going to stop living," Christian, a 66-year-old visitor, told AFP, describing prayer as the "only weapon" in the face of violence.


"It's important to show that life goes on," said Matthieu Guignard, one of the coordinators.


It's not because a few fanatics try to sow fear that we should abandon our faith, our beliefs, our way of living.


Several major events have been cancelled in France since the Nice attack over security concerns, including a huge flea market in the northern city of Lille and the European road cycling championships that had been set to take place in Nice in September.


"For the past week, my fear was that my phone would be ringing with cancellations," Fabien Lejeusne, the priest in charge of the official pilgrimage said last weekend.


Instead, the attacks appeared to mobilise the faithful, he said, reporting a last-minute bookings spurt.


The head of the local hotel workers' union, Christian Gelis, confirmed signs of "increased interest" in the pilgrimage in the wake of the attacks.


Security has been dramatically tightened around the sanctuary built around the shrine, where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared in a grotto to Bernadette Soubirous, a poor shepherd girl, in 1858.


Around 250 police and two dozen soldiers, including bomb disposal experts and officers with sniffer dogs, have been deployed to protect the area.


Pilgrims filing through security barriers have their bags searched at the entrance to the site, where the number of access points has been reduced from a dozen to three.


Catherine Simcox, who made a pilgrimage from the north east of England to Lourdes earlier this month described the heightened security.


"By Thursday morning, there were armed guards inside the sanctuaries and then the gates became single file entry (with metal barriers) with bags being searched on the way in," she told The Local.


"This total freaked my three kids out who are used to Lourdes & it was hard to not scare them when they asked why it was happening," she said.


It didn't spoil my experience, but it saddened me that it was necessary and I understood that some people were reassured by the measures.


The route of Friday's opening procession has also been curtailed -- instead of starting in the town of Lourdes and proceeding to the sanctuary, it will start and end at the shrine.


Other measures taken including shutting down the airspace above Lourdes to flights, closing off the streets around the sanctuary to traffic and replacing rubbish bins with transparent plastic bags.


Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve is to inspect security arrangements on Saturday.


Lourdes attracts around six million people a year, making it one of the biggest sites of Catholic pilgrimage in the world.


Many visitors bring sick or disabled relatives, who come to bathe in a spring in the cave where Bernadette said she saw Mary, believing the water to have healing properties.


Thierry Castillo, another of the organisers, described this year's gathering as "a bit unusual" given "the threat that seems to have taken root in France."


But "it won't affect the quality and depth of what they experience," he assured.


Francoise, a 58-year-old volunteer who was assisting sick pilgrims, admitted she found the presence of soldiers in fatigues "a little overwhelming."


But if it reassures everyone, it's good.


Two injured in Zaragoza shopping centre shooting


Two people have been seriously injured after a man opened fire at a shopping centre in Zaragoza in northeastern Spain.


The incident occurred at 11am on Friday in the busy Aragonia commercial centre in Zaragoza.


Initial reports suggest that the gunman may have shot a woman, believed to be his ex-partner.


The gunman fled after firing the shots and is being hunted by police.


Turkey seeks missing diplomats following coup attempt


Turkey is seeking at least 32 diplomats who failed to return to Turkey in a recall of personnel following a July 15 coup attempt.


Foreign Minister Mevut Cavusoglu said Friday that 208 members of Turkey's ministry staff were recalled to Ankara from posts around the world in an inquiry regarding the coup attempt, and 32 remain missing "without permission."


About 18,000 civil servants, military leaders and academics have been arrested or suspended from their positions in Turkey, the government believing their loyalties lie with U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom it accuses of masterminding the attempt to overthrow the government.


Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania, is on Turkey's most-wanted list.


Cavosoglu said a U.S. Department of Justice team will visit Turkey later this month to discuss his possible extradition.


The issue has become a problem for the United States in its dealings with Turkey, a NATO member.


The United States has objected to the strong-arm tactics of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan following the coup, and Turkey has responded by attempting to develop closer ties with Russia.


Cavosoglu said two Turkish military attaches in Greece fled to Italy, an attaché in Kuwait attempted to escape to Saudi Arabia but was sent back and two generals in Afghanistan were caught in Dubai and sent to Turkey.


He added two civil servants in Bangladesh fled to New York, and one in Russia went to Japan.


The Ankara newspaper Daily Hurryiet, citing military sources, added Turkey's military attaché in Jordan was also missing.


The Wall Street Journal, citing a U.S. official familiar with the situation, reported that a Turkish military officer stationed at a Virginia NATO command center requested asylum in the United States.


There are those who have escaped.


There have been escapees among our diplomats as well," Cavosoglu told broadcaster NTV in an interview.


As of yesterday, time has run out for those initially called back.


We will carry out the legal operations for those who have not returned.


Olympic officials try to clean green-tinged diving pool


Olympic divers planning to practice Friday arrived to a closed pool as officials took more time to clean the green-tinged water before holding the first individual event of the Rio Games.


The water suddenly changed color Tuesday, midway through the synchronized diving events.


Officials insisted the water was safe for competing, even after a larger, adjacent pool used for water polo and synchronized swimming also turned a lighter shade of green.


The diving well was shut down when athletes arrived for morning warmups, though it did finally open at 1 p.m. local time - just 2 1/2 hours before the start of the women's 3-meter event.


The water color appeared to be closer to normal but was still shaded green.


American diver Abby Johnston, who is competing on the springboard, said she showed up for her warmup, only to learn the pool was shut down without any notice.


She wrote on Twitter that "#FixTheSwamp" should start trending.


British diver Tom Daley, who won bronze in the synchro platform event, also commented on the state of the pool in a Twitter post.


Hopefully that means we haven't been diving in anything too bad the last couple of days!


Mario Andrada, chief spokesman for the local organizing committee, stressed that the pool was safe for competition, clearing the way for the 3-meter preliminaries.


He conceded that some athletes were bothered by the water, but said that was a result of efforts to clean the pool.


"We reiterate what we have been saying all along - the water does not offer any threat to the health of the athletes," he said.


In the first day of this water situation, one or two athletes complained about their eyes being itchy.


This was a result that the first reaction when we saw the water turning green was to use one of the chemicals - chlorine - that is very common in swimming pools.


We reduced immediately the quantity.


We retested the water and it was totally within the parameters.


Simon Langford, chief spokesman for the Maria Lenk Aquatics Center, said the pool was closed to allow additional cleaning.


He said the decision was supported by world governing body FINA.


"The reason is that the water must be still so the pool can return to its blue color as soon as possible," Langford said in a statement.


Andrada said officials were caught off guard by the pool's deteriorating condition.


"Chemistry is not an exact science," he said.


Some things, as you can see, went longer than expected.


Rain the past couple of days made it even tougher to get the water color back to normal.


"The rain doesn't help," Andrada said.


He added that athletes had access to dry-land training in the morning, but conceded that "was not ideal."


He explained that the changing color of the pool was the result of increased alkaline levels, much like aquarium water can turn green when not monitored properly.


When we went to fix the green, there was a discussion about the best chemicals.


We can't use too much chemicals in the water because athletes are training in it," Andrada said.


We certainly could have done better in the beginning to prevent the water from turning green.


Once it turned green, we again made another bit of a mistake.

On the evening of August 12 Beijing Time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced the report on the consultation with China in Clause 4, providing analysis and evaluation of China's economic and financial situation.


"China is continuing to switch to sustainable growth and have gained ground on many fields, but it also faces many challenges," said in the Chinese press release published on IMF's official website.


According to IMF's report, despite the decline in economic growth, China's contribution to the global economy in 2015 still accounted for up to one third. China's economic transformation is of benefit to the global economy.


IMF's executive directors commended China for its steadfast determination to enable a more balanced and sustainable economic growth, and noticed that China's economic growth is increasingly driven by services and consumption.


According to the National Bureau of Statistics of the People's Republic of China, China's service industry accounted for 54.1% of its GDP in the first half, and the contribution rate of consumption to economic growth reached 73.4%.


In enterprise debt, IMF's report suggests that comprehensive measures can be taken to address enterprise debt issues.

Shanghai, Taipei to hold forum despite cross-Strait communication suspension


Shanghai and Taipei will hold their annual city forum from Aug. 22-23 in Taipei, Shanghai municipal authorities announced Friday, despite current suspension of cross-Strait communication mechanisms.


Senior municipal official Sha Hailin, on behalf of Shanghai Mayor Yang Xiong, will lead a delegation to attend the forum, the Shanghai government announced via its official microblog account on Sina Weibo.


The forum has been held by the two cities in rotation since 2010.


The 2016 forum will focus on exchanges in fields such as health care, smart cities, culture and transportation in a bid to "deepen exchanges and cooperation in various aspects" between the two cities, according to the Shanghai government.


The Taiwan side has failed to recognize the 1992 Consensus, which endorses the one-China principle, since new leader Tsai Ing-wen assumed office in May, leading to the suspension of communication and consultation mechanisms.


Ma Xiaoguang, spokesman for the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office on the mainland, said Friday that the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations can be maintained as long as the Taiwan side adheres to the political foundation of the 1992 Consensus.


"We hold an active and open attitude toward exchanges between cities of both sides," Ma said, stressing that the nature of cross-Strait relations and city exchanges should be interpreted correctly.


Ugandan president meets Chinese FM, anticipates closer cooperation


Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on Thursday thanked China for its long-term support for Uganda's development and wished for closer cooperation while meeting Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.


China is an old friend of Uganda and Africa, who has sided with Africa during the continent's liberation from colonialism and later supported Africa's economic and social development, Museveni said.


The president cited the Tanzania-Zambia Railway built in the 1970s as an evidence of China's generous support even when China was by then not so prosperous itself.


China has carried out multifaceted cooperation with Uganda, ranging from infrastructure and business investment to cultural exchanges, Museveni said, adding that such kind of cooperation is more conducive to Uganda's long-term development than simply providing aids.


He hopes China can, through various ways, join in Uganda's infrastructural development and construction of industrial parks.


He also welcomes more Chinese to invest and travel in Uganda.


Wang Yi hailed the progress Uganda has made in industrialization and agricultural modernization, adding that China will continue to play the role of Uganda's most reliable and ideal cooperation partner.


China stands ready to try its best in helping Uganda pursue economic and social development, Wang said, noting that Sino-Ugandan cooperation is sincere and without any political strings attached as it is based on high-level political trust and time-tested friendship.


He said China would strengthen its cooperation with Uganda on construction of infrastructure and industrial parks, and support the east African nation to develop its energy and agriculture sectors.
