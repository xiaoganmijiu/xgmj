"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exercise pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said following a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.


The US stance has drawn backlash from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.


Germany's leading organization for industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.


"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.


Elizabeth Warren Will Take "Hard Look" At Running For President in 2020, Massachusetts Senator Says


Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "hard look" at running for president following the midterm elections.


During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she'd consider running.


"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.


"After November 6, I will take a hard look at running for president."


Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall, saying he was "taking this county in the wrong direction.


"I am worried down to my bones about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.


Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.


In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before voting."


A poll released on Thursday, however, showed a majority of Warren's own constituents do not think she should run in 2020.


Fifty-eight percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.


Thirty-two percent supported such a run.


The poll showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent against it.


Other high profile Democratic names discussed in regard to a potential 2020 run include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.


Biden said he would decide officially by January, the Associated Press reported.


Sarah Palin cites Track Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally


Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on Sept.


He was arrested and charged in a domestic violence incident on Monday night


"What my own son is going through, what he is going through coming back, I can relate to other families who feel ramifications of PTSD and some of the woundedness that our soldiers do return with," she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.


Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans, "they come back a bit different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is that respect for what it is that their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, has given to the country."


He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence assault on a female, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.


18 states, D.C. support challenge to new asylum policy


Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.


Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum-seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.


The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions suit that the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.


She said her partner "and his violent gang member sons," abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum July 20.


She was detained in Texas.


The states' attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of applicants for U.S. asylum, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.


The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.


District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."


"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a bar violates that principle," the friend-of-the court brief said.


Attorneys further argued in the brief that the policy denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply necessary labor."


Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.


"Asylum is available for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.


Asylum was never meant to alleviate all problems -- even all serious problems -- that people face every day all over the world.


Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors


For survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.


"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby boy at an evacuation centre in the gutted city of Palu.


"Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.


Clean water is scarce."


Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking through waterlogged belongings, trying to salvage anything they could find.


Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake, were overwhelmed.


Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to continuing strong aftershocks.


Tears filled his eyes as he recounted feeling the violent earthquake shake the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.


"There was no time to save ourselves.


I was squeezed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.


"I heard my wife cry for help, but then silence.


I don't know what happened to her and my child.


I hope they are safe."


U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' with 'propaganda ads'


A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in a U.S. daily touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.


U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to the China Daily's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's biggest selling newspaper - after accusing China of seeking to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.


Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.


While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them level rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.


China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states such as Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts have said.


Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.


China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."


"In disseminating its propaganda, China's government is availing itself of America's cherished tradition of free speech and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.


"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, given that media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.


He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers dodged the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.


Republicans Alienating Women Voters Ahead of Midterms With Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn


As many top Republicans stand-by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, analyst have warned they will see a backlash, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.


The emotions surrounding this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on record already showing they wanted to go forward with a vote.


Those things can't be walked back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School told The Hill for an article published Saturday.


Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to placate angry voters.


"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow and not in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.


On Friday morning, protestors chanted "November is coming!" as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.


"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to be off the chart," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.


"People are saying it's already been high; that's true.


But it could be higher, particularly among swing women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who while they don't like the president, often don't vote."


Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.


"This has become a muddled mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.


"It's just not about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is put on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to elect Democrats, pointed out to the news channel.


However, Americans appear to be somewhat split over who to believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with slightly more siding with the latter.


A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.


Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh has probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while just 30 percent said the same about Ford.


After the push from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations brought forward by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.


Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh drunkenly assaulted her at the age of 17.


Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they attended a party during their time studying at Yale in the 1980s.


The Inventor of the World Wide Web Plans to Start a New Internet to Take on Google and Facebook


Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.


The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds off of Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.


Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and what people are allowed to have access to what information.


In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination."


"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.


"It's a historical moment."


The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.


It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.


It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and all at the same time.


What's unique about the personal online data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access what kind of information.


The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."


The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is for the company to bring resources, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid available to everyone.


The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.


Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.


Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change where all their business models are completely upended overnight.


"We are not asking their permission."


In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."


In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.


In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.


Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.


"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee added.


Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross cleric celebrated


The only Church of England cleric to win a Victoria Cross during World War One as a combatant has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years on.


Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.


However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honour.


A commemorative stone was unveiled by his two grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.


One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years on from his grandfather's award-winning feat.


According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."


He later rushed up to the firing line and with the "greatest gallantry" led the line forward before rushing a field-gun single-handed and knocked out three of the detachment.


Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.


Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something that I know that I could never live up to but something which is humbling."


He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.


Michael Vann said he was "feeling very honoured to play a part in the parade" and added "the valour of a genuine hero is being demonstrated by the support that is going to be given by a lot of people."


MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead


Imagine this, you have stayed up all night to watch the a packed Bellator 206 only to be denied watching the main event.


The bill from San Jose contained 13 fights, including six on the main card and was being shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.


At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were left stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.


Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the fight.


One fan on Twitter described the switch to the children's cartoon as "some sort of sick joke."


"It's government regulation that at 6 a.m. that content was not suitable so they had to switch to children's programming, " said Dave Schwartz, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the transmission.


""Peppa the pig," yes."


Bellator company president Scott Coker said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK viewers in the future.


"I think that when I think about the replay, I think that we can probably work it out," Coker said.


"But it's six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to work this out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.


But we are working on it.


Believe me, when it switched over there were a lot of texts going back and forth and they all were not friendly.


We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.


But it wasn't, it was a governmental issue.


I can promise you the next time it's not going to happen.


We'll keep it down to five fights instead of six - like we normally do - and we tried to overdeliver for the fans and we just went over.


It's an unfortunate situation."


Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' over sexuality


Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.


The 24-year-old said he did not realise until he went to secondary school that "not everyone is like me."


Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope."


He also said becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.


The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a number of months off because of illness.


Appearing as a castaway on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt "less than" everyone else growing up because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."


He said: "To this day, those feelings of feeling less than, and feeling different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."


He wanted to prove that he was "something," he said, so that he did not disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.


The two-time bronze Olympic medallist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.


He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and wanted to give others "hope."


The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man - US film-maker Dustin Lance Black, who he met in 2013 - "caught me by surprise."


Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year but he said the age gap had never been an issue.


"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics aged 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone the same age who had experienced similar highs and lows.


The couple became parents in June, to a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.


"If you had asked me last year, it was all about 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.


"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.


My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."


His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.


Daley said his dad did not accept he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they had their tickets yet for London 2012 - as he wanted to be on the front row.


"I couldn't say to him 'you're not going to be around to be on the front row dad'," he said.


"I was holding his hand as he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he'd actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally acknowledged he wasn't invincible," he said.


The following year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.


"I just knew that this is what I had dreamt of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.


It also inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had resonated with him in the build up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.


Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.


Out-of-form Mickelson benched on Ryder Cup Saturday


American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to turn his form around to avoid it being an unhappy milestone.


Mickelson, playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.


Instead of being at the center of the action, as he so often has been for the United States, the five-times major winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game on the range in the hope of rectifying what ails him.


Never the straightest of drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal fit for the tight Le Golf National course, where the long rough routinely punishes errant shots.


And if the course on its own is not daunting enough, Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, faces accurate British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.


If the Americans, four points down starting the 12 singles matches, get off to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.


Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say much else.


"He fully understood the role that he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.


"He's got a lot of confidence in himself.


He's a Hall of Famer and he's added so much to these teams in the past, and this week.


I probably didn't envision him playing two matches.


I envisioned more, but that's the way it worked out and that's the way we thought we had to go.


He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."


Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.


It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.


Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furyk said his presence brought some intangibles to the team.


"He's funny, he's sarcastic, witty, likes to poke fun at people, and he's a great guy to have in the team room," he explained.


"I think the younger players had fun having a go at him, as well, this week, which was fun to see.


He provides a lot more than just play."


Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows big lead can soon disappear


Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a sizeable lead heading into the last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.


The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans but only just got over the finishing line with their noses in front by the narrowest of margins, winning 14½-13½.


"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only just," said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.


So history will show me and everybody on that team that this is not over.


You go full bore tomorrow.


Get out there and do all the right things.


This is not over till you've got the points on the board.


We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.


I've said all along, I focus on the 12 players that are in our side, but we are so well aware of what's standing across on the other side - the greatest players in the world."


Delighted how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this.


Tomorrow's a different beast.


Tomorrow is the individual performances that come forward, and that is a different thing to do.


It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going good, but when you're out there individually, then you're tested to the full of your capacity as a golfer.


That's the message that you need to get across to players, is get the best out of yourself tomorrow.


Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself, as well."


In contrast to Bjorn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.


Furyk himself has been on both ends of those big last-day turnarounds, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up a loser as Europe pulled off the "Miracle at Medinah."


"I remember every damn word of it," he said in reply to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players heading into the last day.


"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to get off to that fast start like you saw at Brookline, like you saw at Medinah.


When that momentum gets going one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle matches.


We set up our line-up accordingly and put the guys out in the fashion that we felt like, you know, we're trying to make some magic tomorrow."


Thomas has been handed the task of trying to lead the fightback and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.


"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," said Bjorn of his singles selections.


Germany's new warship postponed yet again


German Navy's newest frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace ageing Cold War-era warships, but it won't be there until at least the next year due to faulty systems and snowballing cost, local media reported.


Commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the lead ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.


The vessel should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the troubling post-delivery issues plagued the fate of the ambitious project.


The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy ordered back in 2007 will come as replacement to the ageing Bremen-class frigates.


It is understood they will feature a powerful cannon, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.


Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.


However, continuous delays mean that the cutting-edge warships - said to allow Germany to project power overseas - will already become outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit notes.


The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.


This was the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.


Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.


Software deficiencies were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half of the manpower on older Bremen class frigates.


Also, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.


The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.


Aside from faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also becoming an issue.


It is said to have reached staggering €3.1billion ($3.6bn) - up from initial €2.2 billion.


Problems gripping the newest frigates become especially of importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.


Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged the Navy is actually "running out of deployment-capable ships."


The official said the issue has snowballed over time, because old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were provided.


He lamented that none of the of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.


National Trust eavesdrops on secret life of bats


New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.


It is hoped the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.


The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as brown long-eared and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.


Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.


NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.


Expert sound analysis of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of the bat calls and which species are doing what.


A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.


Rob Dewar, nature conservation adviser for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each of the species.


This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow creation and how best to maintain woodlands for bats and other associated species.


Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the past century.


They are under threat from building and development work that affects roosts and loss of habitat.


Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flypapers and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.


Bats are not actually blind.


However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.


They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to pinpoint bugs and obstacles in their flight path.


The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historical buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.


It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, roost inspections and sometimes rescues.


The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve at Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.


Estate manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for them.


"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.


"We've got the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and all the good habitat.


But there is much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."


He stresses the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within properties as it is possible unwitting destruction of a single maternity roost could kill up to 400 females and young, possibly wiping out an entire local population.


Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their roosts.


Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to pitch in to help.


She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we just don't know how their populations are faring."


Ronaldo dismisses rape claims as lawyers set to sue German magazine


Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as "fake news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.


His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.


The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, named as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.


He is alleged to have then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.


Speaking in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, slammed the reports as "fake news."


"No, no, no, no , no.


What they said today, fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner says into the camera.


"They want to promote themselves by using my name.


It's normal.


They want to be famous to say my name, but it is part of the job.


I am a happy man and all good," the player added, smiling.


Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.


Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."


The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.


After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to papers filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada.


Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" let down by the "one percent."


The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed the pair had sex, but that it was consensual.


Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified of retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."


The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.


Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.


Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers


The UK "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.


He added it was "concerning" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.


"We need a deal," Mr Clark said.


The Japanese carmaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.


The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.


"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.


Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will function, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.


BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.


The main concerns relate to what carmakers say are supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.


Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars made to order.


If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.


It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be stopped.


Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."


"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow as I say not just the success at present to be enjoyed but for us to grasp this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.


"The evidence from not just Toyota but other manufacturers is that we need to absolutely be able to continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains."


Toyota was unable to say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.


Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union convenor at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience once these jobs go they never come back.


A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."


Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House


Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be "pushed back another week" as the fight over supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.


Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, links between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.


Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thereby endanger Mueller's independence, has fuelled Washington gossip for months.


Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president via the 25th amendment.


Rosenstein denied the report.


But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports he was about to resign.


Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.


Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate judiciary committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.


On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.


Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.


Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "A date for that hasn't been set, it could be this week, I could see that pushing back another week given all of the other things that are going on with the supreme court.


But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated."


Some reporters would contest that assertion: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since 10 September.


Host Chris Wallace asked why.


Sanders said the scarcity of briefings was not due to a distaste for TV reporters "grandstanding," although she said: "I won't disagree with the fact that they grandstand."


She then suggested direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.


"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president has prior to him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."


Briefings will still happen, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.


We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot over the last few weeks and that's going to take the place of a press briefing when you can talk to the president of the United States."


Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or participating in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.


Solo press conferences are rare.


In New York this week the president perhaps demonstrated why, making a freewheeling and at times bizarre appearance before gathered reporters.


Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland over Brexit fears


The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish for them to stay on post-Brexit.


Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK withdraws from the EU.


The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the cost of settled status applications for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.


In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and EU on withdrawal have continued, heading towards expected decisions this autumn.


But the UK Government has also been stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.


I know this must be a very unsettling time for all of you.


That is why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of every member of staff, regardless of their nationality.


Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.


Scotland is absolutely your home and we very much want you to stay here."


Christion Abercrombie Undergoes Emergency Surgery After Suffering Head Injury


Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.


Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.


"He came to the sideline and just kind of collapsed there," Reed said.


Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.


An official from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.


Harris added that there are "no details on type/extent of injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.


Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.


He had five total tackles Saturday before exiting the game, which brought his season total to 18 tackles.


Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK


Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy a property in the UK with the extra cash used to help the homeless under new Tory plans


The move will neutralise the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters


The stamp duty rise will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK


The Treasury expects it raise up to £120 million a year- to help the homeless


Foreign buyers are set to be charged a higher stamp duty rate when they buy property in the UK - with the extra cash used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.


The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract young voters with pledges to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.


The stamp duty rise will be levied on individuals and firms not paying tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the Government's drive to combat rough sleeping.


The surcharge - which is in addition to the present stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-to-lets - could be as much as three per cent.


The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.


An estimated 13 per cent of new-build London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing ladder.


Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time out of the country.


The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty cut to help more young people own their first home.


He accused big construction firms of keeping property prices high by snapping up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to abandon quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing disgrace."


Mr Corbyn has announced an eye-catching series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.


He also wants to give councils greater powers to build new homes.


Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.


And that means fixing our broken housing market.


Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.


However, it cannot be right that it is as easy for individuals who don't live in the UK, as well as foreign-based companies, to buy homes as hard-working British residents.


For too many people the dream of home ownership has become all too distant, and the indignity of rough sleeping remains all too real."


Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'


Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become the Scotland manager at some stage.


The Scot, 42, is relishing the challenge of reviving the North-East club, who currently sit third place in League One, three points off the top.


He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.


"I wanted to play for my country as a player.


I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.


"But I grew up watching Scotland at Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it is always something that has drawn me back.


That opportunity would only come, though, if I am successful in club management."


Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.


The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no trepidation in following such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected overtures from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.


"Success for me at the moment will be gauged by 'can I return this club to the Premier League?'


Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.


"It is not an easy task to get it there, but I would probably only view myself as being successful here if I can get the club back there."


Ross is only three years into his management career, after a period as assistant boss at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell on Hearts' coaching staff.


He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to Championship title winners the following season.


And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.


"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled, of taking charge of Alloa.


"I genuinely did believe management was the right fit for me, more so than playing.


It sounds bizarre because I did okay, made a reasonable living out of it, and enjoyed some reasonable highs.


But playing can be tough.


There are a lot of things you have to get through on a weekly basis.


I still go through that in terms of the stresses and pressure of the job but management just feels right.


I always wanted to manage and now I am doing it, it feels the most comfortable I have been in my own skin throughout my entire adult life."

Perfect time for a pint is 5.30pm on a Saturday, survey finds


The summer heatwave has boosted takings for Britain's struggling pubs but heaped more pressure on restaurant chains.


Pub and bar groups saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but takings in restaurants were down 4.8 per cent, figures revealed.


Peter Martin, of business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.


The fall of 1.8 per cent in restaurant trading in June just got worse in July.


Drink-led pubs and bars performed by far the strongest with like-for-likes up more than restaurants were down.


Food-led pubs also suffered in the sun, although not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.


It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.


Across managed pubs and bars drink sales were up 6.6 per cent for the month, with food down three per cent."


Paul Newman, of leisure and hospitality analysts RSM said: "These results continue the trend we've seen since the end of April.


Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home market.


It comes as no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, albeit a sales drop of 4.8 per cent year-on-year will be particularly painful on top of ongoing cost pressures.


The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food-led operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we've experienced in August will provide some much-needed respite."


Total sales growth across pub and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slow down in brand roll-outs.


The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark.

One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, survey reveals


Survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed growth in "fake Insta" pages


The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted


Twenty per cent of pupils said they have a "main" account to show parents


One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.


A survey of 20,000 secondary school pupils revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to photo-sharing site Instagram.


The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted.


Twenty per cent of pupils said they operate a sanitised "main" account to show parents, while also having private ones.


One mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old's daughter's secret site found a teenager urging others to "rape me."


The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half of those admitting to keeping private accounts.


HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing so many teenagers are tempted into creating online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."


Eilidh Doyle will be "voice for athletes" on Scottish Athletics board


Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the governing body's annual general meeting.


Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from her wide-ranging experience at international level over the past decade.


"Eilidh has massive respect across the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure athletics in Scotland would benefit hugely by bringing her on to the board," Beattie said.


Doyle said: "I am keen to act as a voice for athletes and I am hoping I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."


The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Games in Atlanta among his total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular BBC pundit, was left unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.


He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I suffered a stroke.


I could not walk.


Doctors said only time will tell if I will recover or to what degree.


Its been grueling work but made a full recovery, re-learned how to walk and today doing agility drills!


Thanks for the messages of encouragement!"


Breast pump advert comparing mothers to cows divides opinion online


A breast pump company has divided opinion online with an advert that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.


To mark the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a tongue-in-cheek music video-inspired advert to showcase the freedom the new pump gives to expressing mothers.


Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn of cows to a track that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see no tail" and "In case you hadn't noticed these are not udders, they're my boobs."


The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies."


However, the advert, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused controversy online.


With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it makes light of the "horrors" of the dairy industry.


"Very poor decision using cows to advertise this product.


Like us they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except their babies are stolen from them within days of giving birth," one wrote.


The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly inside a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)


Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.


But yeah why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?"


Someone else added: "Such an out of touch advert."


Others defended the advert, with one woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious."


"I think this is a genus idea.


I would've had one if I was still breastfeeding.


Pumping made me feel exactly like a cow.


The advert is a little mad but I took it for what it was.


This is a genius product," one wrote.


Another commented: "This is a fun advert aimed at mums who pump (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like "cows."


This is not an advert praising or judging the dairy industry."


At the end of the video the group of women reveal they've all been dancing with the discreet pumps tucked in their bras.


The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who breast-pump say they feel like cows.


The Elvie Pump however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while pumping.


Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.


By drawing a parallel between expressing women and dairy cows we wanted to put breast pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while demonstrating in an entertaining and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.


This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made the headlines.


During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.


Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Moved to a Tent Camp on the Texas Border


The number of detained migrant children has spiked even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.


Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have feared jeopardizing their own ability to remain in the country by stepping forward to claim a child.


The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.


Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.


The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.


"Close to 80 percent of the individuals that are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are here in the country illegally, and a large chunk of those are criminal aliens.


So we are continuing to pursue those individuals," Mr. Albence said.


Seeking to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.


Many will appear via video conference call, rather than in person, to plead their case for legal status to an immigration judge.


Those who are deemed ineligible for relief will be swiftly deported.


The longer that children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.


Advocates said those concerns are heightened at a larger facility like Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be overlooked, because of its size.


They added that moving children to the tent city without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could compound trauma that many are already struggling with.


Syria tells US, French and Turkish 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately


Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to come home, even though the country's war is now in its eighth year.


Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."


"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the assembly.


Moualem insisted that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, with millions more uprooted from their homes.


He said Damascus would continue "fighting this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" of both terror groups and "any illegal foreign presence."


The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.


France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-wracked country.


On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions were fine for them to return, and he blamed "some western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay away.


"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.


"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue."


The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.


UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.


The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.


Moualem however stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be eradicated."


UN envoy Staffan de Mistura is hoping to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee comprised of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way to elections.


Moualem laid out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be restricted "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.


Why Trump Will Win a Second Term


By that logic, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers are probably hoping, impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.


In what would no doubt be "The most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!"


As of now, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.


Since 2014, prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.


Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.


"This is a fire that people are being drawn to because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, show runner of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor," about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.


Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.


She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.


The driver told her he would be voting for Mr. Trump.


Why? she asked.


"He said, "Because he makes me laugh,"" Ms. Scovell told me.


There is entertainment value in the chaos.


Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story lines coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.


Tuning out is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.


And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself on hour six of watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sourcing for his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-leather bomber jacket ("a garment thick with hubris," The Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniels's lurid descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.


I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.


"Part of what he's doing that makes it feel like a reality show is that he is feeding you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars," about the Trump show's rotating cast and daily plot twists (picking a fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).


You can't afford to miss one episode or you're left behind.


When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.


He couldn't peel himself away, not with Brett Kavanaugh set to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.


"I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows back in the day and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,"" Mr. Fleiss told me.


"I thought it was sort of a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Outside money floods into tightest midterm election House races


It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th is seeing a flood of cash, thanks to a realignment of a congressional districts that landed two incumbents in a race for the same seat.


This recently redrawn suburban Pittsburg district pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.


Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which overlaps heavily with the new 17th.


The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally gerrymandered in Republicans' favor.


The race in the new 17th has touched off a campaign finance slugfest between the major party finance arms, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).


Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a widely watched in March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.


That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.


Political pundits have given Democrats a slight edge.


U.S. Weighed Penalizing El Salvador Over Support for China, Then Backed Off


Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little pushback from Washington.


Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization's management team.


State Department officials decided to call back the American chiefs of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, said in a statement early this month.


But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for narcotics controls, development and economic support.


The proposed penalties, which included cuts to financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.


As internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.


But by mid-September, top administration officials made clear that they wanted the conference to go forward, effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.


Vice President Mike Pence is now slated to address the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a signal of the import the administration places on the gathering, the diplomats said.


And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new tough messages or punishments from Washington.


A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.


Their accounts were corroborated by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the condition of anonymity.


Study History


The next shoe to drop could be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, of which there now is very substantial evidence in the public record.


Mr. Mueller is reportedly also turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.


Should Congress change hands, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that body, just as he prepares to go again before the voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.


That is a lot of ifs, and I do not mean to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable - nor that of his equivalents in Europe.


There are choices to be made by all of us on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how prolonged the struggle may be.


In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d"état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and backed the Czechoslovaks at Munich.


We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that ensued.


The course of history pivots around such inflection points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed.


Americans face several of these inflection points now.


What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?


Rosenstein has been in hot water ever since this paper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his being unfit for office.


Mr. Rosenstein says The Times's account is inaccurate.


"How will we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not full or fair - or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?


And above all, will we vote in the midterms for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?


If we fail those tests, democracy will be in for a long winter.


But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.


My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.


She survived, immigrated to America and, 60 years later, sent me off to light Sabbath candles on that table bearing the swastika.


With that as my heritage, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna clash


Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the Europa League.


A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a springboard to greater things.


"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.


"We went into the game believing we could get something and came away with a point.


Maybe we could have nicked it in the end but, overall, a draw was probably a fair result.


They were probably better in the first half and we came out in the second half and were the better side.


Going into Thursday, it's another big European night.


Hopefully, we can get three points but that will be tough game because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I'm sure we can push on and get a positive result.


Last year was definitely tough, between everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but there's a feelgood factor about the place now.


The squad's good and the boys are really enjoying it; the training's good.


Hopefully, we can push on now, put last season behind us and be successful."


Women are losing sleep over this retirement savings fear


Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people were talking to their family members about it.


About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were speaking with their spouses about the cost of long-term care.


Only 10 percent said they spoke with their kids about it.


"People want a family member to care for them, but they aren't taking the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.


Here's where to begin.


Talk to your spouse and the kids: You can't prepare your family to provide care if you don't make your wishes known well ahead of time.


Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.


Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you come up with a way to pay for those expenses.


Your funding choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses or self-insuring with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.


Hammer out your legal documents: Head off legal battles at the pass.


Get a health-care proxy in place so that you designate a trusted individual to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you're unable to communicate.


Also, consider a power of attorney for your finances.


You would select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure your bills get paid if you're incapacitated.


Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.


Would you be able to answer questions on medications and allergies?


Spell out those details in a written plan so that you're ready.


"It's not just the financials that are in play, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.


"What are the medications?


Who will care for the dog?


Have that plan in place."

Officers described the shooting, which took place at about 02:30 BST, as a "random act."


The victim did not see his attacker.


His injuries are not life-threatening and police have appealed for witnesses.


Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia


At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.


With communications knocked out, relief officials have not been able to get any information from Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.


In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.


Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:


Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.


The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the quake and tsunami hit.


Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi island.


The regency, an administrative region below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.


Fishing and farming are the mainstays of the Central Sulawesi province's economy, especially the coastal region of Donggala.


Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.


Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.


In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.


A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.


Indonesia sits on the seismically Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.


Here are some of the major quakes and tsunamis in recent years:


2004: A major quake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on Dec. 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.


2005: A series of strong quakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.


Hundreds died in Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.


2006: A 6.8 magnitude hit south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, triggering a tsunami that smashed into the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.


2009: A 7.6 magnitude quake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.


More than 1,100 people were killed.


2010: A 7.5 magnitude quake hit one of the Mentawai islands, off Sumatra, triggering up tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.


2016: A shallow quake hit the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded by the devastation of the deadly 2004 quake and tsunami.


No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by fallen buildings.


2018: Major quakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.


The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.


Sarah Palin's Eldest Son Arrested on Domestic Violence Charges


Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.


Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.


According to the police report, when a female acquaintance attempted to call police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone from her.


Palin is being remanded in Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on a $500 unsecured bond, reported KTUU.


He appeared in court Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty, for sure" when asked his plea, reported the network.


Palin faces three Class A misdemeanours, meaning he could be imprisoned for up to a year and fined $250,000.


He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanour, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.


It is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.


In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.


His mother, Sarah Palin, called police to report the alleged attack.


The case is currently before Alaska's Veteran's Court.


In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.


His girlfriend had alleged that he punched her in the face.


Sarah Palin was criticised by veterans groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behaviour to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.


Indonesia earthquake tsunami: hundreds killed


At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.


The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.


Electricity and communication networks are down with death tolls expected to rise in coming days.


The earthquake hit just off central Sulawesi which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.


Videos are circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.


Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami smashed on shore.


Federal prosecutors seeking rare death penalty for NYC terror attack suspect


Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.


Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, mowing down pedestrians and cyclist in his path on Oct.


In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.


Both of those counts carry a possibly death sentence, according to the court document.


Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight charges of murder in aid of racketeering, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.


The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov carried it out as "heinous, cruel and depraved."


"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, harm, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notice of intent states.


Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.


It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.


The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.


The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.


Both Rosenbergs were both put to death by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.


Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.


He stated to investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.


Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.


He also requested to display the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.


He has pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.


David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.


"We think the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved," Patton said.


Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.


Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations


Nigel Farage vowed to 'mobilise the people's army' today during a protest at the Tory conference.


The former Ukip leader said politicians had to 'feel the heat' from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.


Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the march in Birmingham that the UK 'would have been out' by now if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.


But the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by pro-Remain Tories joining a separate protest against Brexit in the city.


The premier is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.


Allies insisted she will push ahead with trying to strike a deal with Brussels despite the backlash - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.


Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to 'chuck Chequers'.


He suggested Mr Farage should have been made a peer and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.


'If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.


The Wellingborough MP added: 'I will stand up for Brexit but we need to chuck Chequers.'


Setting out his opposition to the EU, he said: 'We didn't fight world wars to be subservient.


We want to make our own laws in our own country.'


Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain is completely untrue.'


Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, telling reporters: 'I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.


'Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition's not going to vote for it, it's unpopular with our party and our activists who actually pound the streets and get us elected in the first place.


Please drop Chequers and start listening.'


In a pointed message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'


Mr Farage told the rally politicians must be made to 'feel the heat' if they were about to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.


'This is now about a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class,' he said.


'They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we won't let you get away with doing that'.'


In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: 'I want you to make our political class, who are on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.


'We are mobilising the people's army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit and will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.'


Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.


A smattering of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the launch of the group this weekend.


Labour peer Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with a party app as the conference opened.


'These are the people who tell us they can have the IT systems in place and all of the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,' he added.


'It is a complete farce.


There isn't such a thing as a good Brexit,' he added.


Warren plans to take a 'hard look' at running for president


U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she'll take a "hard look at running for president" after the November elections.


The Boston Globe reports the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a town hall in western Massachusetts Saturday.


Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.


She has been at the center of speculation that she might take on Trump in 2020.


Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents using the town hall format since Trump took office.


An attendee asked her if she planned to run for president.


Warren replied that it's time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top."


Arrest made in shooting death of LSU's Sims


Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.


The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.


They had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.


Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University's campus early Friday.


"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and ultimately died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, per 247sports.


Wayde stepped in to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.


Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on scene, in possession of a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.


Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.


A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.


Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after team orders hand him win over Sebastian Vettel


It became clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes" team orders would play a large part in the race.


From pole, Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton out to dry as he defended his position in the first two turns and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.


Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton to run into the traffic at the tail of the pack, something which should have been decisive.


The Mercedes pitted a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside free at risk of holding out after a double-move to defend on the third corner.


Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.


He then led for a large part of the race as he held onto his tyres to target a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.


He eventually came into the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen took fourth.


It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman told let me by.


The team have done such an exceptional job to have a one two," said Hamilton.


That Was Really Bad Body Language


President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.


Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mean and nasty and untruthful."


"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is going on over the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people that are angry and mean and nasty and untruthful," he said.


"When you look at releases and leaks and then they say "oh, I didn't do it.


I didn't do it."


Remember?


Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?


Remember her answer... did you leak the document - "oh, oh, what?


Oh, no.


I didn't leak."


Well, wait one minute.


Did we leak...No, we didn't leak," he added, in an impression of the senator.


Feinstein was sent the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.


"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story," Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.


"She asked me to hold it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."


But her denial did not appear to sit well with the president, who commented during the Saturday night rally: "I'll tell you what, that was really bad body language.


Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen."


Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.


"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.


You see the meanness, the nastiness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," Mediaite reported the president saying.


Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants


Patrick Dwyer hit two goals for the Giants against Dundee


Dundee Stars atoned for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.


The Giants got an early two-goal lead through strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.


Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home side level before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.


Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured their victory.


It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had come from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.


It was a fourth meeting of the season between the sides, with the Giants winning the previous three matches.


Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute on 3:35 from a Kendall McFaull assist, with David Rutherford providing the assist as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.


In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home side back into the game on 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became provider for Cownie's equaliser on 15:16.


Dwyer made sure the Giants took a lead into the first break when he hit his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.


The home side regrouped and Bouchard once again put them on level terms with a power play goal on 27:37.


Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match late in the second period and he made sure of the win with his team's fifth halfway through the final period.


The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, are at home to Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.


Air Traffic Controller Dies To Ensure Hundreds On Plane Can Escape Earthquake


An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people made it safely off the ground.


More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.


Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.


But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.


He stayed put to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.


He then jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.


He died later in hospital.


Spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.


We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.


Unfortunately we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.


"Our heart breaks to hear about this," he added.


Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach the thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying that access to the the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.


"The toll is believed to be still increasing since many bodies were still under the wreckage while many have not able to be reached," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.


Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.


Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.


Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.


Clean water is scarce.


The mini-markets are looted everywhere."


Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is racing to help survivors but we don't know what they'll find there.


This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."


Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking all of you to work day and night to complete every tasks related to the evacuation.


Are you ready?" CNN reported.


Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.


Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man missing after lagoon plane crash


The airline operating a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after earlier saying all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.


Air Niugini said in a release that as of Saturday afternoon, it was unable to account for a male passenger.


The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.


The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.


Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.


Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.


The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.


What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.


The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon short of the runway.


Some witnesses thought the plane overshot the runway.


American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.


"That's an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.


Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.


He said the flight attendants were panicking and yelling, and that he suffered a minor head injury.


The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a wharf also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to shuttle people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.


Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades but none involved Air Niugini.


Analyst lays out timeline of night woman was burned alive


The prosecution rested its case Saturday in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.


U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.


He outlined for the jury how he used cellphone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.


Rowlett said he received location data from several cellphones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the evening of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported .


When data showed his cellphone was with Chambers' during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.


Sanford took the stand Saturday and testified that he wasn't in town that day.


When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because my truck was in Nashville."


Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.


Cellphone records indicated they'd only known each other for a week.


Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.


"He erased her from his life," Hale said.


The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments Sunday.


The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.


The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?


A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.


The High Breed, from Bristol, claim hip hop moved away from its origins of political messages and tackling social issues.


They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.


Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.


Another black person?!


NY nanny sues couple over firing after "racist" text


A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after receiving a misdirected text from the mother complaining that she was "another black person."


The couple deny they are racist, likening the suit to "extortion."


Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when finding out that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black upon arriving for her first day of work in 2016.


"NOOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.


However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.


After realizing her gaffe, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was instead expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.


Ms. Maurice was paid for her one day of work and then sent home for an Uber.


Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation over the firing, and is seeking compensation to the tune of $350 a day for the six-month, live-in gig she had initially been hired to do, albeit without a contract.


"I want to show them, look, you don't do stuff like that," she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know it's discrimination."


The couple have hit back at the claims that they are racist, saying that terminating Maurice's employment was the reasonable thing to do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.


"My wife had sent her something that she didn't mean to say.


She's not a racist.


We're not racist people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.


"But would you put your children in the hands of someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?


Your newborn baby?


Come on."


Likening the suit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife was just two months off having a baby and was in a "very difficult situation."


"You're going to go after someone like that?


That's not a very nice thing to do," the investment banker added.


While the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to denounce the couple on social media, slamming them for their behavior and logic.


Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn't relate to a talking bear, new letter reveals


Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put oneself in the shoes of somebody reading it for the first time before it was published.


It's very amusing knowing now what we know about Paddington's huge success."


Saying her father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy bear, would have been sanguine about his work being rejected, she added the 60th anniversary of the books publication was "bittersweet" after his death last year.


Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she added her father was quietly proud of his eventual success.


"He was quite a quiet man, and he wasn't a boastful person," she said.


"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like if you have a child who achieves something: you're proud of them even though it's not your doing really.


I think he viewed Paddington's success sort of in that way.


Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to give the credit to Paddington himself."


My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone


On landing her daughter had been rushed to Nice's Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.


"Nad was calling regularly to say it was really bad, that she wasn't expected to make it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.


"Then I got the call from Nad to say she was going to die within the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.


And I did.


I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.


I'll be with you soon.


I'll be with you.


The drugs doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly petering out and leaving her system.


She had died some time before hand and this was it all shutting down.


I had to just sit there and wait, knowing this was all unfolding.


I couldn't howl or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.


I had to really hold it together."


Eventually Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, by now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - oblivious to the ordeal she was going through.


"No-one knew," she said.


"I had my head down, and tears were falling the whole time.


It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.


That he needed my love and understanding.


I knew how much he loved her."


Grieving women post cards to prevent suicides on bridge


Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.


Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been posting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.


Ms Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering with depression and killed himself aged 18.


"I don't want any parent to feel the way I have to feel everyday," she said.


Ms Davis, aged 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious grin.


"Everyone knew him for his smile.


They always said his smile lit up any room."


However, he gave up work before he died, as he was "in a really dark place."


In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one to find his sibling after he had taken his own life.


Ms Davis said: "I continually worry that there's going to be a knock on effect."


Ms Davis created the cards, "to let people know there are people out there that you can go to and you can talk to, even if it's a friend.


Don't sit in silence - you need to talk."


Ms Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after the death of his mother.


"He didn't say that he was feeling down or depressed or anything," she said.


"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change in attitude.


He was at rock bottom on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't make eye contact with them or anything."


She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to work through it: "It rips a hole through the family.


It tears us apart.


But we've all got to carry on and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI begins investigation


"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation limited in time, limited in scope - we could maybe bring a little unity," said Mr Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "falling apart" amid entrenched partisan gridlock.


Why didn't Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?


Their reluctance is all due to timing.


The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, then they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the land.


George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call Senators, lobbying them to support Mr Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr Bush's personal secretary.


What happens after the FBI produces its report?


There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.


It's still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get to at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break a tie and confirm him to the Supreme Court.


North Korea defector numbers 'drop' under Kim


The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.


Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South's unification ministry, said there had been 1,127 defections last year - compared with 2,706 in 2011.


Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by people smugglers were key factors.


Pyongyang has made no public comments.


The vast majority of defectors from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.


Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.


Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.


China regards the defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.


Relations between the North and the South - who are still technically at war - have markedly improved in recent months.


Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that centred on the stalled denuclearisation negotiations.


This came after June's historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards the nuclear-free Korean peninsula.


But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.


"Without any trust in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.


Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court


House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.


Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.


"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever performed that way, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.


Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.


During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times nearly shouting and choking up while discussing his family and his high school years.


He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.


Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed that he is biased against Democrats.


"I think that he disqualifies himself with those statements and the manner in which he went after the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.


Pelosi demurred when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if Democrats gain the majority in the House of Representatives.


"I will say this -- if he is not telling the truth to Congress or to the FBI, then he's not fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, but to be on the court he's on right now," Pelosi said.


Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.


Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative justice.


In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh sidestepped questions on whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.


"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to the court and expect us to say, 'isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.


And Women Need to Wield It.


It is a righteous diatribe, months and years of fury spilling over, and she can't get it out without weeping.


"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem said to me 45 years later.


"I don't think that's uncommon, do you?"


She continued, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive someplace, who said she also cried when she got angry, but developed a technique which meant that when she got angry and started to cry, she'd say to the person she was talking to, "You may think I am sad because I am crying.


I am angry."


And then she just kept going.


And I thought that was brilliant."


Tears are permitted as an outlet for wrath in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.


One of my sharpest memories from an early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping with inexpressible rage, was my being grabbed by the scruff of my neck by an older woman - a chilly manager of whom I'd always been slightly terrified - who dragged me into a stairwell.


"Never let them see you crying," she told me.


"They don't know you're furious.


They think you're sad and will be pleased because they got to you."


Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential runs.


In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business and bowed out of the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, figured there was no reason she shouldn't explore the idea of running for president herself.


"It was not a well-thought-out decision," she said to me with a laugh 30 years later.


"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.


Somebody called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""


Because it was late in the campaign, she was behind on fund-raising, and so she vowed that she wouldn't enter the race unless she raised $2 million.


It was a losing battle.


She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would give her only $250.


"Do they think I get a discount?" she wondered.


When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so overcome by emotions - gratitude for the people who'd supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to target voters rather than delegates, and anger at the sexism - that she got choked up.


"You would have thought I'd had a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.


"You'd have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.


I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?


"She cried"?""


How the US-China trade war may be good for Beijing


The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long term, experts say.


Donald Trump, the US President, fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminium.


The most significant escalation rolled in this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items, effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the US from China.


Beijing has retaliated each time in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of five to ten per cent on $60 billion of American goods.


China has pledged to match the US shot-for-shot, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.


Getting Washington to back down means caving into demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.


Still, experts say if Beijing can play its cards right, US trade war pressures could positively support China over the long term by lowering the inter-dependence of the two economies.


"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that start an economic tailspin in either country is actually a lot more dangerous than onlookers have acknowledged before," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.


Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister


Syria says it's ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by a more than seven-year long war.


Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.


"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress made in combating terrorism," he said.


The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.


All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and their livelihoods.


The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.


Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.


Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.


But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or help from countries that sponsored the insurgency.


Europe clinches Ryder Cup victory in Paris


Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.


The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.


Europe regained the crown as the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they required to beat the United States.


US star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tournament, plunked his tee-shot into the water at the par-3 16th hole, conceding his match to Francesco Molinari.


The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all of his rounds, becoming 1-of-4 players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format begun in 1979.


American Jordan Spieth was blown out 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.


The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.


A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the tournaments all-time winningest European with 25.5 career point.


"I don't usually cry but today I can't help it.


It's been a rough year.


So thankful for Thomas to pick me and believe in me.


I am so happy, so happy to get the cup back.


It's about the team., and I'm happy I was able to help," said an emotional Garcia following the European victory.


He passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram who took down US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play on Sunday.


"The incredible pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching that guy," said 23-year-old Rahm.


Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.


A strange statistic by one of the greatest players of all-time, having won 14 major titles second to only Jack Nicklaus.


Team USA struggled all weekend to find the fairways with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the entire tournament.


US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.


There was time this morning when we put some heat on Europe.


We scrapped.


Hats off to Thomas.


He is a great captain.


All 12 of his players played very well.


We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move forward.


I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to serve as captain.


You have to tip your cap.


We got outplayed."


Red Tide Update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota


The newest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in Red Tide concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.


According to the FWC, patchier bloom conditions are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - which suggests decreasing concentrations.


A bloom the Red Tide extends approximately 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.


Patches can be found about 10 miles offshore of Hillsborough County, but at fewer sites relative to last week.


Red Tide has also been observed in Pasco County.


Medium concentrations in or offshore of Pinellas County have been reported in the past week, low to high concentrations offshore of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations in or offshore of Sarasota County, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations in or offshore of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.


Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.


Respiratory irritation was not reported in Northwest Florida over the past week.
