New Questions Over California Water Project


Critics and a state lawmaker say they want more explanations on who's paying for a proposed $16 billion water project backed by Gov. Jerry Brown, after a leading California water district said Brown's administration was offering government funding to finish the planning for the two giant water tunnels.


Critics said the government funding described by the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District on Thursday could run counter to long-standing state assurances that various local water districts, not California itself, would pay for Brown's vision of digging twin 35-mile-long tunnels to carry water from the Sacramento River south, mainly for Central and Southern California.


The $248 million in preliminary spending for the tunnels, which have yet to win regulatory approval, already is the topic of an ongoing federal audit.


On Wednesday, state lawmakers ordered a state audit of the tunnels-spending as well.


On Thursday, state spokeswoman Nancy Vogel said that despite the account of the Los Angeles-based Metropolitan Water District, no money from the state's general fund would be used finishing the current planning phase of the twin tunnels.


However, opponents of the tunnels and a taxpayer group were critical Thursday, and Assemblywoman Susan Eggman, one of the state lawmakers behind this week's audit order, asked the state Thursday for clarification.


"It's a shell game," said David Wolfe, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association's legislative director.


I think it comes back to the audit (request) yesterday: There are way more questions here than there are answers.


The tunnels project is endorsed by Brown and by some politically influential water districts and water customers in Central and Southern California.


Supporters say the tunnels would benefit the environment and offer Californians a more secure water supply.


Opponents say they fear the state will use the tunnels to divert too much water from the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay, harming Northern California and further endangering native species there.


Metropolitan and other water districts slated to get water from the tunnels have yet to commit to paying for them, out of uncertainty whether the massive spending would really bring them enough water to make the cost worthwhile.


The same water districts also announced this year they would not pay to complete the current preliminary work on the tunnels unless the project first won regulatory approval.


On Thursday, a monthly report published by the LA-based water district on the tunnels project said, "the state has indicated that any additional funding needs to complete the planning phase will be provided by state or federal sources."


After all that local water districts had spent on the project, including $63 million from his water district, "This is to be expected" that the state would use government money to close out planning, said Bob Muir, spokesman for the LA-based water district.


He referred further questions to Vogel, the state spokeswoman.


Vogel said the state intended to pull money to finish the tunnels planning from user fees for an existing, half-century-old water network, the State Water Project.


Tunnel opponents, however, point to a measure state lawmakers passed in 2009 that they say bars the state from spending money on the tunnels until the water agencies that would benefit commit to paying for them.


"Project contractors pledged to pay for this project and they've used financial gimmicks to get around this obligation," said Patricia Schifferle, an environmental consultant and longtime opponent of the proposed tunnels.


It raises questions as to where this money was suddenly found.


Business Groups Appeal to China Over Cybersecurity Law


A coalition of international business groups has appealed to China to change proposed cybersecurity rules they warn will harm trade and isolate the country.


The letter to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is signed by 46 groups from the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, reflecting the global scale of concern the rules might limit or cut off access to China's market for information security products.


Signers include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the European Services Forum and groups from Japan, Korea and Mexico.


The proposed rules would require providers to show Chinese authorities how security products work and to store information about Chinese citizens within the country.


The latest letter, dated Wednesday, says that might make data theft easier and reduce access to Chinese customers.


Tianjin chemical blast: Deadly disaster marked one year on


Zhang Mengfan says the public deserves to know what happened in the Tianjin blasts


China's leaders may want muted commemorations to mark the first anniversary of the massive chemical blast that killed 173 people, but not everyone agrees.


John Sudworth reports from Tianjin.


Almost anywhere else in the world the anniversary of a disaster of this magnitude would present a moment of national soul-searching.


But not in China.


While a memorial service to some of the dead firefighters is being held in the city of Tianjin, elsewhere the tributes are being muted.


The Communist Party-controlled media is being told what it can and cannot say and some survivors, as well as family members of the dead, are being warned not to speak to the foreign press.


But 23-year-old Zhang Mengfan won't stay quiet.


"On this anniversary there should be a way for the public to know what happened," he tells me.


I don't want silence.


On 12 August last year, Mr Zhang was a radio operator with a military fire brigade, stationed just a kilometre from the epicentre of the explosions.


"The call came in at 10:53 that night and we started to despatch my teammates," he says.


It would have taken them 10 minutes to get to the scene.


Other crews from elsewhere in the city were also arriving to tackle the large fire in a chemical storage depot.


All of them would have been oblivious to the fact that large quantities of volatile and toxic substances were being illegally stored, way beyond permitted amounts and without proper management.


The fire had started when a batch of nitrocellulose - a chemical used in nail polish - had been allowed to dry out and then ignited in the summer heat.


It then spread to a huge stockpile - 800 tonnes - of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.


The resulting explosions shattered the windows and brought the roof in at the fire station where Zhang Mengfan was waiting by the radio for reports from the scene.


Those reports never came in.


"When I saw the mushroom cloud I fell into a state of desperation," he tells me.


I knew what it would mean for my friends.


Of the 26 firefighters sent to the blaze from his unit that night, eight never came back.


Many of the others suffered serious burns and other injuries.


The biggest of the two large explosions was measured as a seismic event, with a blast wave that was felt many kilometres away.


The total cost of the damage was put at more than $1bn, including the 300-plus buildings that were destroyed.


A total of 173 people lost their lives - 104 of them firefighters.


Eight bodies have never been found.


An official government enquiry has laid the blame squarely at corruption, political connections and official collusion that allowed corners to be cut and safety systems to be overridden.


The storage depot should never have been built so close to residential buildings in the first place.


More than 100 officials and company executives are facing some kind of disciplinary or criminal investigation.


So while the government can point to the progress that has been made - the thousands of homes repaired and the residents compensated - those lingering sensitivities remain.


The disaster has exposed the cracks in a system where rapid economic growth is a priority and the lack of independent oversight is a fact of life.


The bravery and sense of duty that night cannot be doubted and yet alongside the image of the firefighter as hero, there is the other uncomfortable picture.


That of the firefighter as victim, sent without proper knowledge into an avoidable, man-made catastrophe.


Zhang Mengfan has now left the fire service but will attend the memorial service in Tianjin.


He will be carrying in his heart a message for his dead comrades.


What I want to tell them most is this: I've been to visit your parents and they are fine.


Leave your parents to me.


I am a member of your family now.


I will fulfil your filial duty.


Cold spring could affect Scottish grouse shooting season


Scotland's grouse shooting season will begin later, with cold weather hitting bird numbers this year.


Several estates have postponed shooting as many of the early chicks did not survive the cool spring conditions.


Marking the start of the season, the Scottish Gamekeepers Association (SGA) said grouse shooting sustained more jobs than the Edinburgh festivals.


But animal protection charity OneKind called for an end to the "brutal slaughter" of the birds.


The organisation's director Harry Huyton said: "The effort which goes into maintaining a rich supply of game birds for shooting is huge and invariably involves some extremely controversial practices."


It is not surprising the public is turning their back on this so-called sport and calling the government to account on a cruel, unnecessary practice which is enjoyed by a very small minority of people in Scotland.


But landowners insisted they were committed to conservation and that grouse shooting was vital to the rural economy.


The SGA's chairman, Alex Hogg, said the industry supported 8,800 full-time jobs per year in remote areas and was a "rich seam of employment" in uncertain times.


He said: "Compared to many other European countries, Scotland does not have an embedded 'hunting' culture and chunks of the population don't know the impact the shooting seasons have to the country, economically."


Mr Hogg said the number of full-time jobs relying on shooting exceeded the posts created by the Edinburgh International Festival, the Fringe, Tattoo and Hogmanay combined.


He added: "There are real concerns for employment in rural Scotland at the moment, particularly in oil and gas, so gamekeepers and their families want to see the industry grow.


We want to work with the Scottish government to make sure hard working people can continue to rely on these posts in future.


RSPB Scotland believes that eight golden eagles have been killed illegally around grouse moors


Many gamekeepers acknowledge that grouse shooting is not universally popular, but the SGA said the industry had made "significant strides in terms of best practice."


The opening day of the grouse shooting season is traditionally known as the "Glorious Twelfth."


However, the sport remains controversial and the management of grouse shooting moors has been linked to the persecution of raptors by some wildlife bodies.


On Thursday, RSPB Scotland said eight tagged golden eagles had disappeared in the Monadhliath mountains, south-east of Inverness, in less than five years.


The wildlife charity believes they were killed illegally around grouse moors and their satellite tracking tags destroyed.


Scottish Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the reports were "very disturbing and disappointing."


Ms Cunningham has ordered officials to analyse the evidence of about 90 surviving and missing eagles with the tags, to determine if there is a pattern of suspicious activity.


The Scottish Moorland Group accused the RSPB of trying to whip up anti-shooting feelings ahead of the grouse season and said there was no clear evidence of the birds having even died in the Monadhliath area.


Rio Olympics 2016: Bryony Page wins trampoline silver for Great Britain


GB's Page wins silver in the trampolining


Bryony Page became the first British woman to win an Olympic trampoline medal by claiming silver in Rio.


Page, 25, was beaten to gold by 0.425 points as Canada's Rosannagh MacLennan won a second successive Olympic title with a score of 56.465.


World champion Li Dan of China took bronze, while Britain's other finalist, Katherine Driscoll, came sixth.


I can't believe I've won an Olympic medal.


I'm just so happy," said a clearly emotional Page.


I had no idea it was a medal but my performance was the best I could have done, that is why I was so happy, that all the training and hard work had paid off.


I am so happy I got to share the final with Kat, one person would have been history and we got two.


Prior to winning Olympic silver, Page's highest career finish in an international event was fifth at the 2015 World Championships in Denmark.


Trampoline made its Olympic debut in 2000 and this is the first time British women have reached the final.


Reaction to the medal.


Team GB's Nathan Bailey, the only male entrant in the men's trampoline on Saturday, was ecstatic.


Two-time Olympian gymnast Hannah Whelan was quick to heap praise on Page's achievement.


Page secured a first class honours degree in Biology at the University of Sheffield.


Rio 2016: Fiji fans celebrate winning rugby sevens gold medal


A 12-year-old boy runs past sugar cane fields on a half-mile journey to the nearest television set in order to watch the game


Extraordinary scenes of celebration have erupted after Fiji won its first-ever Olympic medal.


Banks closed, shops shut and revellers took over the streets of Suva dancing, singing and cheering.


Fiji claimed the gold medal after defeating Great Britain 43-7 in the rugby sevens final at Deodoro Stadium.


Thousands of people across the island nation had stopped what they were doing to watch the history-making match.


Fiji celebrates as the country wins its first ever Olympic medal


Many supporters dressed in Fiji colours and rugby jerseys, carrying the national flag to cheer on the team.


At the final whistle blew, excited revellers took to the streets cheering and dancing.


"Some people even stopped their vehicles on the busy streets of Suva and got out with Fiji flags to join the celebrations, not paying much heed to the slight traffic jam they cause," the Fiji Times reported.


The celebrations will definitely continue into the weekend and the week ahead.


League of Ireland Premier Division: Finn Harps 0-5 Derry City


Aaron McEneff netted two first-half penalties for the visitors at Finn Park


Derry City have moved up to second in the Premier Division thanks to a thumping 5-0 derby win over Finn Harps.


Aaron McEneff put the Candystripes in control with two first-half penalties, both given for fouls on Lukas Schubert.


Nathan Boyle fired home early in the second half and Schubert hammered in the fourth before Keith Ward's late lob completed the Finn Park rout.


Derry go a point ahead of Cork City and the teams meet at the Brandywell on Monday night in a crunch encounter.


It was Derry's first win over their north-west rivals in three meetings this season and they were rarely troubled by a disappointing Harps side.


McEneff tucked away the opener on 17 minutes after Ciaran Coll's challenge on Schubert, although the foul appeared to be outside the box.


There was no doubt the second spot-kick, with former Candystripes midfielder Barry Molloy bringing downing Schubert and McEneff making it 2-0 three minutes from the break.


Boyle produced a clinical finish from a Dean Jarvis cut-back eight minutes after the restart.


City keeper Gerard Doherty had a quiet night but he made a fine save to deny David Scully in the host's best opening of the game.


Schubert flicked the ball past Coll before blasting in after 83 minutes and it was soon followed by Ward's clever chip over Harps stopper Richard Brush.


It was Derry's biggest win of the campaign and perfect preparation for the showdown with Cork.


Probe after mass failure of Inverness College UHI course


An entire class of 20 students may have failed a Higher Media course run by Inverness College UHI.


Most of those on the course were 17 and 18-year-olds hoping to use their mark from their studies to go to university.


Inverness College UHI said quality assurance processes were in place, adding that the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) was investigating.


A spokesman for the SQA said the nationally-available 2016 Higher Media assessment had "performed as intended."


Twenty students signed up for the Inverness College UHI-run and marked course.


Many of the students were young people in rural areas who received tuition online, but also had to make frequent visits to the college in Inverness from where they lived in places such as Lochaber.


A father of one of the students said that, following postings by his daughter on social media about her no award for her work, at least 10 others had come forward to say they had also been given a no award for their course work.


He told BBC News Scotland online that about five other people who sat the same course at Inverness College UHI last year had also been in touch to say the same thing had happened to them.


The situation meant his daughter not being able to secure a place at the University of Glasgow, but she will be able to take up an offer from another university because of qualifications she gained at school.


But her father said there were others who did the college-run media course who were less fortunate and were now "in limbo" and unsure if their course work would be re-examined and then given a mark that would allow them to take up university places.


Inverness College UHI is part of the University of the Highlands and Islands.


Diane Rawlinson, principal and chief executive at Inverness College UHI, said: "We take exam results and student success very seriously."


This is evidenced by the excellent HMIE report we received earlier this year as well as the year-on-year improvements to attainment levels we have achieved in both Further and Higher education.


As we do every year, we are undertaking a review of all published results, comparing them against those projected for each student.


In the case of this particular course, the usual quality assurance processes were in place and the awarding body verifier recently reported 'significant strengths in the delivery and management of this award' and confirmed that 'assessment judgements were consistent with the national standards set'.


SQA are currently investigating this matter at our request.


A spokesman for the SQA said: "We are happy that the 2016 Higher Media assessment performed as intended and it provided candidates with the opportunity to show their understanding of the subject.


Many candidates performed strongly and we saw a slight increase in the A-C attainment rate compared to the same qualification last year.


It was designed in line with past and exemplar papers and according to our course and assessment specifications.


Brothers jailed for samurai sword 'bloodbath' in Kilmarnock


Jason Bryden was attacked with a samurai sword, knife and nunchucks


Two brothers have been jailed for killing a man with a samurai sword after a drugs-related robbery in East Ayrshire turned into a "bloodbath."


The victim, Jason Bryden, 38, was repeatedly stabbed during the attack at his home in Kilmarnock on 5 July 2015.


At the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark, 36, was jailed for a least 22 years after being convicted of murder.


His brother John, 38, was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide.


Jailing both men, judge Bill Dunlop told the brothers that they had carried out "a merciless, relentless and savage attack."


He rejected any suggestion that Mr Bryden had been laying in wait for them armed with a samurai sword.


Judge Dunlop added: "You together planned to gain illegal access with at least one knife and nunchucks.


Jason Bryden may have been a drug dealer but he was a son, a father and a friend.


He was butchered by you.


After both men were jailed, Det Insp David Moran, who led the investigation, said: "The violent and terrible actions of John and James Clark caused the death of Jason Bryden."


To be taken at the age of 38, in such horrifying circumstances, is a heartbreaking situation that the family has been forced to endure.


The court previously heard the brothers, from Kilmarnock, had decided to rob Mr Bryden of a gold bracelet which they had given to him in exchange for drugs.


The pair, who were high on drink and drugs, went to his home after masking their faces with scarves and arming themselves with a knife and martial arts nunchucks.


The sword used in the killing is believed to have belonged to the dead man.


Neighbours said they could see the Clarks attacking Mr Bryden as he sat on a sofa by the window and could hear him screaming.


Prosecutor Richard Goddard told the trial: "This was a sustained, frenzied attack on this man."


Afterwards, the scene of the killing was described as a "bloodbath."


In addition to the stab wounds, Mr Bryden suffered blunt force trauma during the assault.


He died in Kilmarnock's Crosshouse Hospital three days later.


Both brothers denied the killing.


In evidence, James Clark, who has 38 previous convictions including one for attempted murder, said: "I didn't mean it. It was an accident."


John Clark, who has 23 previous convictions, said he only got involved to help his brother whom he claimed was being attacked by Mr Bryden.


Man jailed for shaking and killing his baby son


David Sinclair admitted killing the child at his home in East Kilbride in 2012


A man who shook and killed his baby son in a fit of rage because he would not feed has been jailed for seven years and three months.


David Sinclair shook four-month-old Joshua in a "momentary loss of control" at their home in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, on 6 December 2012.


The cause of death was only discovered after a case review by medical experts.


Sinclair, 34, was originally charged with murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of culpable homicide.


Jailing him at the High Court in Glasgow, judge Lord Bracadale told Sinclair: "You assaulted your baby son by shaking him, causing the injuries which killed him."


You must have known at the time you had shaken him, but you did not disclose that.


It was only after extensive medical investigations you admitted what you had done.


Your wife believed in you.


She now feels she had been misled by you and can no longer support you.


Lord Bracadale described the effects of Joshua's death as "catastrophic" for all concerned and added: "Nothing can bring Joshua back."


The court previously heard that that on the day the child died, Sinclair and his wife Kirsty had gone swimming with Joshua and then shopping in East Kilbride.


At 17:30 Kirsty Sinclair went out to meet her mother and sister.


Just 11 minutes later she received a phone call from Sinclair, who sounded "shocked."


He told her: "Joshua isn't breathing properly, come home right away."


He then hung up and dialled 999.


The infant was rushed to Hairmyres Hospital where he died.


Initially the cause of Joshua's death was unascertained, but the case was reviewed by a team of medical experts who discovered evidence of trauma in the eyes and brain which could only have been caused non-accidentally, close to the time of death.


One of the experts, Dr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neuro-surgeon at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, said: "This would be compatible with him having suffered a shaking injury involving handling at greater force than encountered in everyday life."


Defending QC, Ian Duguid, told the court that Sinclair was "extremely remorseful" for his actions.


Rio Olympics 2016: Chloe Tutton appears to question Yulia Efimova


GB's Tutton misses 200m breaststroke bronze


Great Britain's Chloe Tutton appeared to criticise controversial swimmer Yulia Efimova's presence in Rio after the Russian finished ahead of her in the 200m breaststroke.


Efimova, who was allowed to compete after appealing against a doping ban, took silver with Tutton fourth.


"I would've preferred it to have been a completely clean Games," the 20-year-old Welsh swimmer said afterwards.


I couldn't help who was here.


I'm not happy with it, but that's how it is.


Efimova in second place didn't even know she was in the games until three days ago.


I don't want to see people taken out of the sport, but I don't think that's quite right.


She shouldn't have been in the race and a 20-year-old from Britain should have had a medal.


Rie Kaneto won Japan's seventh gold medal at Rio 2016 to beat Efimova into silver.


China's Jinglin Shi won bronze, just six one-hundreths of a second ahead of fourth-placed Tutton.


Her British team-mate Molly Renshaw, 20, finished sixth.


"Being fourth is a bit gutting, no matter who is in front of you," Tutton added.


It's a great experience and I'm a bit disappointed to come fourth.


I'm so close to a medal and that would have been a dream.


But just to get into the final is a great experience that I'll take on with me for years to come.


It was a bit gutting but it will make me tough in the long run and it just makes me more hungry for a medal so hopefully next time I'll get closer.


Tutton finished just 0.01 seconds outside the British record in the women's 200m breaststroke final


'Everyone should have a second chance' - Efimova


Efimova, who said she was tired of answering questions about her doping past, defended her right to compete at Rio.


She was banned for 16 months in 2013 after traces of an anabolic steroid were found in her system.


The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) has ruled that athletes cannot be banned from Rio on the basis that they have been previously sanctioned.


CAS considered my appeal and I won.


If someone dislikes it and has a different opinion, they can go to CAS," she explained.


I am not for doping and I have never used it.


The second case was completely not my fault.


Everyone should have a second chance.


When you drive and you are just issued a ticket, no-one puts you in jail.


Ben Proud powers to 50m freestyle final


Earlier, Ben Proud set a British record to reach the men's 50m freestyle final.


Commonwealth champion Proud, 21, swam a time of 21.54 seconds to qualify fifth fastest for Friday's final (02:44 BST Saturday).


Your delegation is pushy and rude


India's sports minister, Vijay Goel, has been a conspicuous presence at Rio's Olympic Games, frequently spotted in the stands cheering on Indian athletes and taking selfies after their events.


But he and his large entourage have apparently raised the ire of Olympic officials with unruly behavior, repeatedly trying to push their way into competition zones without the proper credentials and responding rudely when checked, the Press Trust of India reported.


Vijay Goel, pictured in July, has defended his behaviour.


On Wednesday, Olympic organizers threatened to withdraw Goel's accreditation if the behavior did not improve, sending a warning letter after he and his entourage tried to enter restricted areas in the gymnastics venue and the arena where fencing and taekwondo is held.


"We have had multiple reports of your Minister for Sports trying to enter accredited areas at venues with unaccredited individuals," Sarah Peterson, continental manager of the Rio 2016 Organizing Committee wrote in the note.


When the staff tried to explain that this is not allowed, they reported that the people with the Minister have become aggressive and rude and sometimes pushed past our staff.


"Should our protocol team be made aware of further examples of this type of behavior, the accreditation of your Minister for Sports will be cancelled and his privileges at the Olympic Games withdrawn," the letter continued.


The leader of the Indian delegation called the matter "a non-issue being made an issue" and Goel himself said he had done nothing wrong, chalking it up to a "misunderstanding."


He tweeted, "To my knowledge, we have been following all rules & regulations.


We are committed to the spirit of Olympics & back our Indian players.


Otherwise it's been a gloomy Olympics for India, with zero medals so far.


Bummed-out fans on social media noted that Michael Phelps now has as many medals - 26 - as India has won in its history.


Several prominent contenders have already been eliminated, including shooter Abhinav Bindra who won a gold medal in Beijing in 2008.


He placed fourth this time.


What a waste of money and opportunity," author and columnist Shobhaa De said in a sardonic tweet.


But some bright hopes remain, with competitors foraging ahead in boxing, golf, tennis, track and field and, yes, badminton.


The lone Indian woman gymnast, Dipa Karmakar, will compete in the vault finals on Sunday - showing off her fearsome double revolution "Vault of Death," the Produnova, attempted by few other gymnasts.


For a country of 1.25 billion people, India's low medal count has always been a source of consternation.


Analysts say that there are myriad reasons for this.


The national obsession is cricket, which is not an Olympic sport.


India has not invested heavily in infrastructure and training for Olympians - Karmakar's first vault was made from parts of an old scooter.


Parents have historically emphasized academics over sport.


And the sports' governing bodies have been dogged by corruption.


The International Olympic Committee suspended the Indian Olympic Association for violations of its charter in 2012 because they had elected leaders with pending criminal charges.


In Sochi, India's three winter Olympians were not even allowed to compete for their country, carry the flag or wear the insignia.


They competed as independents.


Injuries force turbulence-rocked Boston-Sacramento JetBlue flight to land in South Dakota


A JetBlue plane was forced to make an unexpected landing Thursday evening after 22 passengers and two crew members were injured during turbulence, reports CBS Sacramento.


Flight 429, from Boston to Sacramento, landed in Rapid City, South Dakota shortly before 7:30 p.m. local time.


The airline says the injured were transported to a hospital for evaluation.


JetBlue says it sent personnel to assist the injured, and a replacement aircraft was flown to Rapid City to take the rest of the passengers on to Sacramento.


DEA's missed opportunity on medical marijuana


The answer sadly is: unlikely.


And this is a missed opportunity that could further delay potential therapies to countless people.


Up until today, there has been only one federally approved source of research-grade medical marijuana, at the University of Mississippi.


In a bit of seemingly positive news today, the DEA also announced it will now allow other places to apply for permission to do the same.


The hope is that marijuana available for scientific study could grow in both amount and diversity.


While this will be hailed as a victory for research, it will largely be symbolic, because no matter how much marijuana is available, if access is still difficult, it hardly matters.


Imagine a product that is in high demand but kept behind a locked door.


In response to the demand for the product, someone makes a baffling decision to make more of it but still never unlocks the door.


Marijuana is that product, and its Schedule I designation is that locked door.


That is the predicament of medical marijuana.


Because marijuana is a Schedule I substance (meaning that by definition it has "no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse"), there are significant hurdles to getting the door unlocked.


Potential researchers typically go to the DEA first, as it grants the license to begin scientific research.


Even if a license is granted, to study a Schedule I substance, institutions must have heavy-duty safes and high-grade security systems installed, which can be expensive.


There is also the more subjective consideration of getting approval from your academic institution to do the research on a Schedule I status substance in the first place.


Even if individual faculty members want to do that research, the university leadership may not want the hassle or the potential fallout of bad press.


This happened at the University of Arizona when Dr. Sue Sisley was let go after trying to pursue a medical marijuana trial.


Sisley eventually had to find private funding for her project, and just in April, seven years after the study was initially proposed, hers became the first DEA approved medical marijuana trial for post-traumatic stress in veterans.


Then, after years of bureaucratic hurdles, it is the National Institute on Drug Abuse that has held the final key to the lock.


Today, it is the biggest federal public funder of marijuana research and has been the sole supplier of the marijuana itself.


Even if more medical marijuana will now be freed up for research, the institute will still have to approve any studies it funds.


The problem, however, is that last word in its name: "abuse."


According to Dr. Donald Abrams at the University of San Francisco, whom I interviewed for my documentary "Weed," the institute has a primary mandate to study substances for potential abuse rather than as a medicine.


Abrams makes an important point.


Even if a study does cross all the hurdles described above, the door may stay locked if the intent is to study the benefits of medical marijuana as opposed to the harm.


Consider this: A quick (and admittedly non-scientific) search through the U.S. National Library of Medicine pulled up 1,434 papers on medical marijuana over the past five years.


That same search revealed only 57 papers on medical marijuana benefits.


The vast majority were research into the harm of marijuana, such as "Bad trip due to anticholinergic effect of cannabis," "Cannabis induced pancreatitits" and "Marijuana use and risk of lung cancer."


That imbalance paints a highly distorted picture.


The road to medical marijuana research is paved with surprises and hypocrisy nearly everywhere you look.


While the DEA continues to dig in on Schedule I status, deeming no medical benefit, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services simultaneously holds a patent on cannabinoids for a wide range of medicinal purposes.


The DEA continues to place marijuana alongside heroin and LSD as drugs with high abuse potential even though the DEA's own former chief administrative law judge, Francis Young, disagreed with this.


In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods we commonly consume.


For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response.


By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death.


Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.


By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.


Again, that was from a judge with the DEA itself.


And yet nearly 30 years later, little has changed.


Whether we realize it or not, we all accept a certain amount of hypocrisy in our daily lives.


Maybe we don't always have the energy to call it out or we are too speechless and dumbfounded that no one else seems to have noticed.


With regard to the hypocrisy of federal medical marijuana policy, however, it is worth summoning the stamina to relentlessly present the facts.


The lives of patients -- such as that of Charlotte Figi, whose seizures abated with the use of medical marijuana, and so many others -- depend on it.


That a plant could provide so much benefit and still remain behind these locked doors is worth speaking up about.


Bloody Beetroots: Donald Trump 'a blonde Berlusconi'


The Bloody Beetroots is known for electronic dance music


The musicians say Trump's dominance of the media is similar to Berlusconi's


"You know, we used to have Berlusconi in Italy and to me, Trump looks like a blonde Berlusconi," Rifo, who is the founder of electro-dance punk formation, The Bloody Beetroots, told CNN.


The Republican presidential nominee and the Italian media mogul turned politician are both known for their larger than life personalities, their skills in capturing the attention of the press and shaping narratives in the media.


As the Bloody Beetroots, Rifo is known for his electronic dance music and has collaborated with artists from the legendary Sir Paul McCartney to electro-pop singer Greta Svabo Bech in the 2013 song, "Chronicles of a Fallen Love."


Rifo was born in the Italian town of Bessano del Grappa outside Venice in 1977, which is around the time punk rock was born, and the numbers "1977" are tattooed across the musician's chest.


"English is not my main language so I don't understand everything about your world," Rifo said from behind a black mask, which he is known for.


I try to explore and I've been trying to improve my understanding of your culture.


Rifo urged Americans to watch "Videocracy," a documentary which explores Berlusconi's monopoly over the Italian media.


The documentary is about "how Berlusconi used to drive Italy crazy," Rifo said, adding that Trump has had a similar effect on America.


"You see the way a man can completely invert the system and curve everything ... for his wants," he said.


Trump, to me, looks like something that is not good for this country.


Two Turkish sailors jailed over £500 million drugs bust


Two Turkish men convicted of smuggling £500 million worth of cocaine on board a ship in the North Sea have each been jailed for at least 20 years.


Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen were found guilty after a trial at the High Court in Glasgow after three tonnes of the Class A drug were discovered inside the MV Hamal about 100 miles off the coast of Aberdeen.


The 2015 seizure is said to be the biggest single cocaine haul ever recovered at sea in Europe.


Mumin Sahin and Emin Ozmen have been jailed for their role in a huge drug deal


The massive haul of drugs found on the boat is one of the biggest in British history


The drugs were found hidden in a specially-adapted secret hold in the Tanzanian-registered tugboat, which was sailing from Istanbul to Tenerife and then to the North Sea.


It was stopped by the Royal Navy frigate HMS Somerset and Border Force cutter HMC Valiant.


Sahin, 47, was sentenced to 22 years while Ozmen, 51, was handed down a 20-year term at the High Court in Glasgow.


Judge Lord Kinclaven told the men the quantity of drugs was 'not only significant but massive' and drugs trafficking had a 'devastating impact' on people and communities.


He said: 'You were involved in a most serious operation of commercial scale involving the transportation of cocaine by ship, in an operation which crossed international and indeed intercontinental boundaries.'


He told the ship's captain Sahin, he was 'not at the top of the drugs tree' but had played an important role in the offence, while second captain Ozmen's role was 'to some extent a lesser one'.


Officers boarded the Hamal following a tip-off from French customs body DNRED, and once it was docked in Aberdeen they drilled through a steel plate into a secret compartment to find 128 bales of cocaine weighing 3.2 tonnes, with an estimated street value of £512 million.


MV Hamal was boarded by the Royal Navy last year.


Three tonnes of cocaine was onboard


Tonnes of the Class-A drug were crammed in the ship's ballast tank when it was raided


The ship went from the Bosporus to South America before being stopped in the North Sea


The entry to the space was found under a wardrobe in one of the crew's quarters, with the opening cemented over.


Sahin and Ozmen were found guilty of being concerned with the carrying and concealing of cocaine on the ship between February 20 and April 23 last year, and of being concerned in the supply of cocaine between April 21 and April 23.


The men, both first offenders who have worked in the shipping industry since leaving school, continue to maintain their innocence but accept the jury's verdict.


Charges against four other men were found not proven.


Sahin's lawyer, Jonathan Crowe, said the married father-of-two was a 'glorified mule'.


He said: 'Someone who was involved in the transportation of the drugs.'


Someone who was able to captain a boat.


In regard to the drugs hierarchy, Mr Sahin is certainly not at the top of the drugs tree but somewhere further down.


The sheer amount of cocaine on the ship meant they had to be removed by a crane


Police spent days going through the boat before the drugs were divided into these boxes


Sahin was approached about captaining the Hamal in February 2015, the court heard.


Mr Crowe said he is 'devastated' about missing out on milestones for his daughter, nine, and son, 13, and 'just wants to go home to Turkey'.


Both men have not seen their families since being taken into custody in April 2015 as their families struggle to get visa approval.


Ozmen's lawyer, Di Moore, said he is 'desperate' to see his family but knows that will 'remain impossible' for the foreseeable future.


Speaking following today's sentencing, Scotland's Crown Agent prosecutor David Harvie said: 'The international drugs trade does not respect borders, and those of us whose job it is to dismantle it are working ever-closer together to ensure we stay one step ahead.


'Scotland's reach in pursuing criminals is on a truly global scale and in this case we have dealt a substantial economic blow to organised criminals.'


Drugs were packed into every cavity in the boat, including under the floors


This package of contraband was found hidden in the ship's laundry room by officers


Mr Harvie added:'The Hamal was identified after an intelligence tip-off from French authorities, and swift co-operation from the Attorney General in Tanzania where the ship was registered allowed it to be boarded.


'Our investigation then stretched from Guyana, who provided access to crucial shipping records, to Spain, who gave us crucial information on the ship's stop-offs in the Canary Islands.


We also worked with colleagues in Denmark, Norway and the United States to piece specific elements of the evidence together.


Despite strong intelligence that the Hamal was carrying a large volume of drugs, it could not be boarded in international waters by the UK authorities without the permission of the Tanzanian government - something they had never previously granted.


Sue Patten, head of the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) International Justice and Organised Crime Division, said: 'Acting quickly and precisely, the CPS criminal justice adviser in Tanzania was able get permission from the Tanzanian authorities to board the boat within 24 hours of receiving the intelligence.


Under international maritime law, the UK cannot board a vessel in international waters which is under the flag of a foreign state unless that state gives specific legal permission to do so.


Without the swift actions of our criminal justice adviser, there was a high risk that the vessel may have escaped and we would never have been able to bring these men to justice.


Photographer Brian Romeijn captures the decaying 'Orient Express' train


Rotterdam-based photographer Brian Romeijn snapped these photos of an abandoned train in Belgium


Images show the train's rusting exterior, torn seats, dust-covered windows and compact engineer's room


It has gained a reputation as an Orient Express carriage, but it belonged to Belgium's national operator


An urban explorer has captured these remarkable photos of the decaying remains of a passenger train that was once one of the finest ways to travel.


With their glory days long gone, the train carriage and locomotive have been left to rot at a train yard in Belgium, where they have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers.


Rotterdam-based photographer Brian Romeijn, 40, snapped these eerie images, which show the abandoned train's rusting exterior, torn seats, dust-covered windows and floors and compact engineer's room.


The train carriage and locomotive have been left to rot at a train yard in Belgium, attracting urban explorers


Those trains were a symbol of luxury when they operated under that legendary name from 1883 to 2009.


The locomotive was used by Belgium's national rail company around 50 years ago.


After 126 years on the rails, the last train service operating under the Orient Express name was from Strasbourg to Vienna in December 2009, bringing an end to a celebrated history.


The Orient Express famously operated between Paris and Istanbul.


When it started in 1883 - run by La Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits - it was known as the Express d'Orient.


It became the Orient Express in 1891 and by the 1930s operated scheduled services throughout Europe.


It's not to be confused with the privately run Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.


Very few Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits luxury carriages still exist.


This snap shows the compact engineer's room, where equipment is rusting, gauges are still installed and wires are exposed


Romeijn said the engineer's room was 'kind of claustrophobic and the noise of the engine must have been tremendous'


The abandoned locomotive and carriage have become a popular attraction for photographers and adventurers


After visiting the forgotten train in Belgium, Romeijn told MailOnline Travel: 'I really could feel how it must have been used in its heyday.


Wealthy gentlemen with high hats are joined by ladies in beautiful dresses on their journey.


Make-up artist Katelyn Galloway transforms into Arrested Development's Buster Bluth


Her impressive make-up skills, reviews and transformations have earned the Texan YouTuber Katelyn Galloway an army of fans.


But her latest transformation, into Buster Bluth from Arrested Development, is pretty incredible by anyone's standards.


In a three minute video uploaded to her Kiki G YouTube channel, Ms Galloway slowly and steadily transforms herself into the hapless, hook-handed character.


She even uses some audio from the show at the end of the clip, in an eerie albeit brilliant tribute.


The talented make-up artist begins her video as her regular blonde, female self.


Then, via clever use of time-lapse photography, she slowly morphs into the balding, bespectacled 'motherboy' that is Tony Hale's Buster Bluth.


Ms Galloway does this by the likes of coloured contact lenses, shading and contouring around the nose and eyes, as well as painting Buster's face onto her head.


Clever ways: Via clever use of time-lapse photography, she slowly morphs into Tony Hale's Buster Bluth


She also takes on the personality and mannerisms of the cult TV character over the course of the video, tucking in her chin appropriately.


The clip, shared on YouTube, has been viewed more than 45,000 times, and commenters have been quick to laud the make-up artist's skills:


'You are extremely talented,' one person wrote underneath Ms Galloway's post.


She also takes on the personality and mannerisms of the cult TV character over the course of the video, too


'I love how you stay in character while you're doing these,' someone else added.


Vlogger Katelyn Galloway had previous viral success with her transformation into Parks and Recreation character, Ron Swanson.


She has told her YouTube followers that she hopes to create weekly make-up transformations in the near future.

Lancashire father banned from children's school after wearing T-shirt with swear word


A father-of-two has been banned from his children's school for turning up at their sports day in an offensive T-shirt.


Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley, in Lancashire, says he 'accidentally' wore the top with the slogan "Let's get out there and t**t it'.


But despite apologising when he realised his error and turning the T-shirt inside out, the next day he discovered he was barred from the school grounds.


The single father, who had been a governor for four years at Park Primary School, in Colne, Burnley, was unable to pick up his kids because of the ban and the staff even called social services and the police.


Craig McBeth, 36, from Burnley says he was barred from the school grounds after wearing this offensive T-shirt to his children's sports day


Mr Burnley has accused head teacher Sarah Midgely of overreacting.


He said he is being unfairly punished for mistakenly putting on the T-shirt in a rush before going to watch his two children compete.


The dad, who has now quit as a school governor, said: "It was a mistake, and an oversight on my part.


I was not thinking about sports day and rushing when I put it on.


Towards the end of the event we were having a father's race and the head teacher noticed my T-shirt and said it was not appropriate.


I apologised and turned it inside out and thought that was the end of the matter.


But the 36-year-old said he received an email from the chairman of governors later that evening asking him to meet with the head the next day, but he did not see the need after he had already apologised.


"The headteacher then phoned me and said I was barred from the school premises," added Mr Burnley,


I found out after the sports day some of the parents went on Facebook and made a fuss about it and that got a lot of people interested.


Any right-minded person would think this was an overreaction.


Mr McBeth, who is the editor of an online magazine called Love Mini, said he believed he could not even pick his children up on the last day of term, because of the ban.


But this prompted a phone call from the school and social services.


The t-shirt had a picture of Craig Charles's character Lister from the cult BBC comedy Red Dwarf with one of his iconic lines -'Let's go out and t**t it.'


He commented: "I told them I was not there because they had banned me from the school.


I then got a phone call from social services asking why I had not picked my daughter up.


The school also called the police because I did not pick up my daughter for about 40 minutes.


Mr McBeth claims he was told he is no longer permitted to come on to the school premises and the prohibition will continue until further notice.


He says he was also warned he could face a fine of £500 if found trespassing.


Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said this matter is now closed


Sarah Midgley, headteacher at Park Primary School, said: "I can confirm that Mr McBeth has resigned and is no longer a governor at our school.


This matter is now closed and I'm looking forward to getting back to normal school life in September.


Burnley councillor Joe Cooney said the school had clear policies and guidelines.


"We all have to bear in mind when you take on these roles such as a councillor or governor you are held to a higher standard and unfortunately this time he has not met that standard," he said.


Councillor Jonathan Nixon added he did not think the school should have banned him and the situation had been blown out of proportion.


Mr Nixon added: "He was stupid to wear the T-shirt and he apologised at the time."


Lancashire Police confirmed they were called by the school, but did not attend.


65% of Venezuelans want to oust Maduro, the question is if they are willing to fight for it


Two out of three Venezuelans want to revoke President Nicolas Maduro, but the question seems to be whether or not they are willing to fight for it.


The day after the National Electoral Board announced that there is "no time" for the recall vote to take place this year - securing Chavismo's grip of power until 2019 - people in Caracas went about their day as if nothing had happened.


"I didn't hear the news because I was watching the Olympics and how Michael Phelps won two more medals," said Rafael Deyan, a 36-year-old office clerk taking a break in Altamira Square on Wednesday.


Altamira Square, located in the east of Caracas, was the epicenter in early 2014 of fierce riots protesting against Maduro's regime.


Yet now, when the opposition needs to apply more pressure than ever to make the referendum happens this year, people across the country are not showing the same energy.


"I want a referendum, but I won't protest for security reasons," said Deyan.


Others, more informed, are willing to mobilize in the future but admit Venezuelans are less motivated.


Electoral board president Tibisay Lucena's comments prove that the government is hindering the recall process.


I will protest whenever the opposition calls for a protest, but I know that some of my friends are scared," Roberto Reyes, 60, told Fox News Latino.


So on top to the many barriers the government has raised to delay the referendum, the opposition now faces another challenge: motivating people to go out to the streets and protest.


Until recently the referendum initiative had plenty of support - people moved in unprecedented numbers during the collection of signatures phase.


But when it comes to protesting against the government's maneuvers to block the effort, turnout at rallies have been ostensibly low.


"Some people are focused in making food lines, while others are scared after the many arrests and deaths in 2014," said Cipriano Heredia, a lawmaker for the opposition.


After Lucena announced that the next step in the referendum process - gather yet more signatures countrywide - would have to wait until October, those opposed to the socialist government claim President Maduro and his acolytes are just trying to discourage Venezuelans, making them believe that a vote this year is all but impossible.


According to the Constitution, if the referendum were to be held in 2017, Maduro could be forced out of office but he would be allowed to name a successor.


If he were ousted this year, however, he is mandated to call for a general election.


The U.S. Department of State addressed the issue in a statement Thursday afternoon, calling on the Venezuelan authorities to guarantee the exercise of the constitutional rights of the Venezuelan people.


"The remaining steps for the realization of the Presidential Recall Referendum need to be pursued clearly, concretely and without delay, and thus contribute to the quick and effective resolution of the current political, economic and social difficulties in the country," it read.


Luis Salamanca, a political analyst who was a member of the Electoral Board between 2006 and 2009, said change is not likely anytime soon.


"I think that there will not be a referendum this year, unless the social unrest and protests grow much more," he told FNL.


He said that in his view Lucena and the government are breaking the law, but they may ultimately achieve their goal if people don't protest loud enough.


The opposition has called for a big rally on Sept. 1st in Caracas to demand a speed-up of the process so the recall can take place this year.


We want people from all over the country to mobilize to the capital city on that day.


The government will feel the pressure," Heredia said.


But Salamanca thinks that the situation can't wait that long.


"They should have a quicker and stronger response to Lucena's announcement because it practically kills the referendum," the expert told FNL.


Congressman Heredia admitted that some parties inside the opposition are pushing to make the rally sooner, but other groups prefer to have more time to organize.


The opposition has to be careful now.


If people get discouraged by the situation there is a risk of low turnout in the second round of signature petition," said Salamanca.


The referendum process has to count with the support of 20 percent of the country's electorate, close to 4 million people, in order to be activated.


Salamanca and other analysts are confident that even if the recall takes place on 2017, Chavismo will be hurt.


But some are not that optimistic.


Our party wants political change this year.


"If the government closes down the electoral path, we will have to explore other legal options," Heredia told FNL.


Premier League 2016-17 previews No19 West Bromwich Albion


Guardian writers" predicted position 14th (NB: this is not necessarily Alan Smith's prediction but the average of our writers" tips)


Last season's position 14th


Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker) 1,000-1


Until last week it looked like a case of new season, same old West Bromwich Albion: 2016-17 would be another campaign of comfort - or stagnation depending on how empty the glass is - under the ever-pragmatic Tony Pulis.


But then Jeremy Peace sold his 88% stake in the club to Guochuan Lai and Pulis, the archetypal safe pair of hands, was immediately made the bookmakers" favourite in the ever unpleasant market of first manager to be fired.


The landscape has undeniably altered in the Black Country - and not just at The Hawthorns, but a few miles north-west in Wolverhampton, too, where new Chinese owners wasted no time in relieving Kenny Jackett of his services.


Pulis, however, has been given reassurances by Lai that his job is not in immediate threat, and the entrepreneur has also stated his desire not to alter the club culture.


"I have no wish to change the club's ethos or embark on an unsustainable spending spree," he said upon taking over.


I want to be a good owner and to invest in this club for the long term.


First and foremost, our goal is to ensure that we remain in the Premier League and then beyond that, I would like to see the club establish itself in the top half of the division.


I believe it is the best league in the world and I want to take this club as far as possible.


Such is Pulis's record, the first aspect should not be too problematic.


The next aim is to break into the top half of the table, but it will be important for the new owner and an increasingly divided fanbase hoping for a quick shoot up the table to realise that is an increasingly onerous task because of the recent ground made up by other mid-table sides.


To progress from last season's 14th-place finish will certainly require more of an edge up front.


Only Aston Villa, tailed off at the bottom, scored fewer goals and it is worth recalling that at Christmas Albion were averaging fewer than a shot on target per 90 minutes, by some stretch the division's worst.


They failed to score in 13 of their 38 games and found the net more than once on only nine occasions.


Of their 10 victories, not one was by more than single goal and seven finished 1-0.


Predictably, a dozen of their sparse total of 34 came from set pieces.


Little wonder disgruntled reactions were common at The Hawthorns, perhaps most notably after a diabolical 0-0 draw with Villa in late January, when the visitors looked the more likely.


On the flip side, only the top six had better defensive records - though no other club could claim to regularly line up with four centre-halves.


Those defenders are often underappreciated, not least Jonny Evans, who is said to have Arsenal chasing him following their latest injury crisis.


The Northern Ireland international enjoyed a fine European Championship and it would take a hefty fee for Albion to sell.


Ben Foster is dependable in goal and they are well stocked in midfield.


Darren Fletcher, much like Evans, displayed plenty of evidence that he would still be capable of performing at a higher level at 32, and Claudio Yacob is underrated.


Irritatingly for all parties the long and winding tale of Saido Berahino's future remains unresolved.


Bids from Stoke and Crystal Palace were rejected under Peace's ownership but the former remain keen and Mark Hughes is happy to be patient.


After last season was close to a write-off, it makes sense for all concerned for a move to go through.


The striker is undoubtedly talented but with, as Pulis mentioned more than once, people dragging him one way and pulling him the other it has long been evident the relationship is unworkable.


Albion are insistent upon signing a replacement before letting the former England Under-21 international go but their £15m move for Diafra Sakho broke down days before the takeover, with the club stating he had passed his medical and everything was agreed but he had a back injury that would have meant missing the start of the season.


It places a lot of pressure on the Venezuelan Salomón Rondón, who showed brief flashes of promise last season but needs to improve on his return of nine goals, especially if Rickie Lambert continues to be as ineffective.


The decision to release Victor Anichebe and Stéphane Sessègnon also looks odd in retrospect.


Pulis has been notoriously slow to promote young players throughout his career and the sight of three teenagers - Jonathan Leko, Sam Field and Tyler Roberts - in the final game of last season, a 1-1 draw with Liverpool, is unlikely to become the norm.


He will return to the tried and tested but Leko is worth keeping an eye on.


The 17-year-old attacking midfielder made five appearances in total last season, becoming the first player born in 1999 to appear in the Premier League, and is also highly rated in the England underage system.


Matt Phillips, a £5.5m signing from Queens Park Rangers, will provide pace but he is the sole new player entering the opening weekend of the campaign.


It is not wild to suggest the end of the window could be a hectic one.


"All over," Pulis told the Express and Star last month about where needs to be strengthened.


Every position that you look at.


The back players, midfield players and front players, we have to strengthen.


The targets have been there, we know what we want.


Getting them is proving more difficult than envisaged, mostly due to uncertainty during the takeover process.


The season could be defined by how they start, with seven eminently winnable games before a daunting run of Tottenham, Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester from mid-October.


By that point the pressure on Pulis will have eased or become insurmountable.


And, who knows, maybe even Berahino will have found a new club.


Tata Steel UK rescue deal closer after trustees back pension changes


The pension trustees behind Tata Steel UK have said the scheme can be restructured without entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), boosting the prospects of a rescue deal for the company.


The British Steel Pension Scheme has liabilities of £15bn and a deficit of as much as £700m by some measures, making it a serious obstacle for a rescue deal for Tata Steel UK and the Port Talbot steelworks in Wales.


Tata Steel is increasingly confident about securing the future of its UK business, which employs 11,000 people, after talks with the business secretary and the Pensions Regulator.


The company plans to merge its European operations, including the UK business, with those of ThyssenKrupp, the German conglomerate.


However, the deal is conditional on the British Steel Pension Scheme being restructured and the government providing financial support.


Allan Johnston, chair of the pension trustees, said the scheme could avoid falling into the PPF if the benefits for workers were modified.


Although it is well-funded compared with other schemes, with the deficit narrowing to £300m on some measures, Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are keen to keep its liabilities under control.


Johnston said the trustees accepted it "would not be realistic" for the joint venture or any buyer of Tata Steel UK to take on responsibility for funding the current and future deficit.


Modifying the benefits of the scheme was a more attractive option than it entering the PPF, he added, where workers would have to accept reduced terms.


Tata Steel sources have warned it could still sell Port Talbot.


The company has consistently refused to guarantee the future of the steelworks since talks began about the future of its UK business in March, and this has been used as a bargaining chip in talks with the British government.


Koushik Chatterjee, executive director of Tata Steel Europe, said the Indian conglomerate wants to make its steel business "more sustainable."


Speaking at the sidelines of Tata Steel's annual meeting in India, Chatterjee said talks to restructure the pension scheme were progressing, but he insisted the scheme is well-funded.


"We are discussing with various stakeholders, including the British government and other stakeholders like the government of Wales and so on," Chatterjee said, according to the Times of India.


There is a recognition that pension has a certain impact in a commodity business like steel, so we have to find a structural solution, which does not impact the business going forward.


The pension trustees" willingness to cooperate in talks to restructure the scheme will be welcomed by Tata Steel.


The potential changes to the scheme include shifting how the annual inflation-based increase in benefits is measured from the retail price index to the lower consumer price index, as well as limiting future increases in pension payments to the minimum required by law.


Johnston added: "The trustee and its advisers have provided Tata Steel, the government and the Pensions Regulator with compelling evidence of the scheme's ability to pay modified benefits indefinitely and on a low-risk basis outside the Pension Protection Fund.


Our investment strategy has meant that the scheme's funding position has not been affected by recent falls in gilt yields in the same way as many other UK pension schemes, and we remain confident of the scheme's ability to provide modified benefits as proposed on a self-sufficient basis.

A parent was held in administrative detention for beating a school bus driver after his child missed the bus for being two minutes late

The driver felt that he was wronged and called the police. The Ezhou police placed the parent with alleged beating behavior under administrative detention.


Mr. Xiao is a school bus driver of a kindergarten in Wutonghu New Area of Liangzihu District, Ezhou City, Hubei Province. At about 8:00am on August 7, Xiao drove the bus to pick up children in a village in the new area.


"The rain is so heavy today, and we're two minutes late. Can't you wait us for a moment? Why do you drive off? You're so irresponsible!"


Mr. Gong met teacher Zhang after getting off the bus and came into conflicts with her again, leaving an unhappy end.


Mr. Xiao's hands bled and his head was scratched by an umbrella. He also showed symptom of headache.


"I'm only a driver and will drive according to the prescribed time and route, and it is not my fault to drop Xiaoming."


Mr. Xiao felt that he was wronged and reported the incident to the school bus company he belongs to. After discussion with leaders of the company, he decided to call the police.


Due to pressure from the police, Mr. Gong surrendered himself to the Wutonghu police station of the Liangzihu branch of the Ezhou Municipal Public Security Bureau on August 10.

The custody business had achieved an average annual growth rate of 52.89% in the past six years, covering fund, insurance, trust, bank financial management, pension, cross-border investment, social welfare, transaction payment and many other sectors.


Huang Runzhong, head of the Secretariat of the China Banking Association, said asset custody has become an important link connecting the money market, capital market and real economy. It is also an important institutional arrangement to guarantee financial security.


Along with rapid development of China's direct financing market and wealth management market, the asset custody market has played an increasingly important role.


Data from the report on development of China's asset custody industry in 2016 showed that the ratio of assets under custody to deposits reached 62.74% at the end of 2015, versus 17.11% at the end of 2011.


The ratio of assets under custody to total deposits of financial institutions is often used to measure the status and function of the custody sector.


It's noteworthy that China's asset custody mechanism is defective presently. Many sectors have failed to strictly enforce the custody mechanism, or even failed to be placed under custody.


The absence of asset custody mechanism is one of the major reasons to explain the outbreak of risk events in P2P online lending, private equity funds and other sectors.


The report proposed to realize the "complete custody" model, which covers the entire institution and features all assets and complete processes, in a push to better guarantee financial security and maintain investors' interests.


Currently all P2P platforms will draw huge amounts of loan loss provisions, the value-added tax of which is not deductable as assets after the reform of replacing business tax with VAT.


Shenzhen recently held a special training on finance and tax for the Internet finance industry, with finance and tax experts offering suggestions to the city's Internet finance enterprises.


The numerous problems faced by the city's Internet finance enterprises in finance and tax were thrust into the spotlight during the training session, which was hosted by the Shenzhen Internet Finance Association and co-organized by the Shenzhen Certified Tax Agents Association.


"As cases of absconding with funds occur frequently in the industry, P2P platforms' drawing of hue loan loss provisions has undoubtedly become an important means to stabilize investors' confidence."


Hu Mianpeng, President of the Shenzhen Junhexin Finance and Tax Service Agency, said that if enterprises don't pay the loan loss provisions they have drawn, they need to pay a considerable amount of added-value tax.


"But if P2P platforms negotiate with insurance enterprises to purchase the specific product launched by the latter, it could be used for VAT deduction, and then the enterprises' costs will be reduced."


Hu advised that the Shenzhen Internet Finance Association could negotiate with insurers to make a forward-looking attempt in the pilot city of the Internet finance program.


Something new has been seen in the Chinese A-share market presently - the stock index bounced back to 3,000 points amid a widespread bearish sentiment. Behind this, retail investors' sentiment remained subdued, while foreign investors have increased their holdings of A shares for seven consecutive months.


"I'm less confident in the stock market above 3,000 points, and feel jittery about the expansion of new share issue", elder stock investor Mr Chen told journalists of Wuhan Evening News.


Core changes of the market become the lingering volatilities surrounding the A-share market after the abnormal fluctuations in 2015, with many issues pending. Money supply in the market remained weak, making it very hard to earn money.


An Everbright Securities report indicated that as a whole, the investment sentiment remained subdued in July, with new funds from individuals being on the decrease.


The decrease of transaction settlement fund balance in the securities market in July was smaller than that in June, while the net bank-securities transfers stood at negative RMB 66.6 billion.


As for the number of new investors, there were about 310,000 new investors each week in July, which still stayed at a low level.


Northbound Trading Link (NTL), which has seen continuous net inflow of foreign capital, recorded a net capital inflow of RMB 8.7 billion in July, higher than the previous month.


Foreign investors' increased holding of A shares also implies the growing attraction of the current A-share market.


For retail investors, the Shanghai Composite Index fared well thanks to the continuous inflow of funds to the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect for a long time.


There are a few changes deserving attention in terms of operation: 1) changes expected to be brought by launch of the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock Connect; 2) the catalysis effect arising from announcement of interim reports and third-quarter reports.


Currently Singapore has become the city's third largest overseas destination for cross-border RMB settlement, second only to Hong Kong and Taiwan.


Implementation of these pilot policies has created a good financial service environment for construction of the China-Singapore (Chongqing) strategic interconnection demonstration project and promoting inland area opening-up and development.


As the application situation changes every year, the settlement threshold and scale are likely to vary from the previous year.


The administrative measures also stipulated that under the rating-based settlement publicity mechanism, applicants who have got the qualified rating need to make publicity before settlement.


Units and individuals who falsify in the process of policy implementation will be disqualified for application in the same year and the next five years, and the settlement will be cancelled as well.


When the public security organ investigated the case, four relevant parties, namely, two former cooperation companies, the chairman of one of the two companies and the jointly-established hotel company, signed an "agreement" over problems in the case.


During performance of the agreement, the two parties brought each other to court again, petitioning the court to affirm invalidity of the "agreement".


Recently, the People's Court of Hailar District, Hulunbeier City, Inner Mongolia, ruled on the case.


Inner Mongolia Hulunbeir Zhongwei Real Estate Development Co., Ltd. and Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) Investment Co., Ltd. jointly developed a real estate project - Hulunbeir Shiji Tianlun Hotel.


Mr. Dong once acted as chairman and legal representative of the hotel company after its establishment with joint contributions by the two companies.


Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel agreed that Mr. Dong would apply for withdrawing the case with the public security organ after performing the obligations prescribed in the agreement, and they will no longer hold Mr. Dong and other related personnel responsible for legal liabilities.


After Mr. Dong fully performs the agreement, Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel will announce a waiver of rights to hold Zhongwei Real Estate Development, Mr. Dong and other related persons liable for criminal and civil responsibilities.


According to the "agreement" signed on April 24, 2014, the four parties agreed to reach an agreement over fund embezzlement and appropriation by Mr. Dong and his subordinate staff.


The agreement mainly prescribed the amount of funds Mr. Dong should return and the return time as well as the equity transfer and legal representative change of Shiji Tianlun Hotel Company.


In October 2015, Zhongwei Real Estate Development and Mr. Dong, two parties of the agreement, brought the other two parties, namely, Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing) and Shiji Tianlun Hotel Company, to court.


The defendants replied that the public security organ's judicial audit came to the conclusion that Mr. Dong and the accountant embezzled and appropriated over RMB 29 million of funds.


In February 2014, Mr. Dong got in touch with Zhongqing Ganglian (Beijing), and the two parties signed the "agreement" after negotiations at the public security organ's meeting room.


Mr. Dong pleaded guilty, expressed confession and threw himself on the mercy of the court. He also returned the RMB 5 million of Shiji Tianlun Hotel Company.


The entrusted agent of the plaintiffs said Mr. Dong learned after consulting legal specialists that it was controversial whether or not the "borrowing" behavior could be criminalized.


The "agreement" was signed provided that Mr. Dong was convicted of the embezzlement crime, in contravention of the Twelfth Article of the Criminal Procedural Law.


Giving criminal sanctions and equity transfer fall into different legal scopes, and the duo can't be confused and traded. What's more, equities can't be used to exchange for "impunity". The "agreement" covers illegal purposes in legal forms.


The plaintiffs opined that it is the national public power of public security organ, procuratorate, court and other national legal authorities to give criminal sanctions, which is not bound by private appointments.


The agreement signed by the two parties on April 24, 2014 violates the compulsory provisions of the national laws and regulations and infringes the social and public interests.


Therefore, no matter whether Mr. Dong constitutes a crime, the agreement on "a waiver of rights to give criminal sanctions on the opposite side" has no legal effect.


The entrusted agent of the defendants deemed that the "agreement" is the civil understanding reached between criminal suspects and victims in the process of criminal proceedings.


The "agreement" is signed and performed to recover the victims' financial losses to the greatest extent and reduce the criminal punishment on criminal suspects, which are not illegal purposes nor contrary to compulsory provisions of laws and regulations.


It was Mr. Dong's real intention to sign the "agreement", which was legal and effective after being signed and sealed by all the parties concerned.


The defendants thought that the "crime of position encroachment" and the "crime of funds misappropriation" are public-prosecuted cases, and it should be decided by the public security organ whether or not the case should be withdrawn, rather than the reporter.


The agreement is just an appointment, under which the victims would apply with the public security organ for withdrawal of the case after Mr. Dong fulfilled the agreement, which is not in conflict with the exercise of national public power to give criminal sanctions.


Meanwhile, the court held that the liability for breach of contract is beyond the scope of ordinary civil agreements, and validity of the agreement should be reviewed in the process of criminal proceeding.


After receiving the alarm, the Yu County Government and the Yangquan Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately started formulating an emergency response plan and set up a command to clarify missions and jobs, expound work measures, fulfill job duties and make a comprehensive plan.


Currently the public security organ is still further investigating other alleged irregularities of the gang members.


The plaintiff deemed that there are multiple faults and mistakes in the two hospitals' diagnosis and treatment for the plaintiff. The plaintiff claimed a compensation of RMB 833,815 from the two hospitals and brought them to court.


If all disputes are sued and filed separately, it will increase litigation exhaustion of the public and extend the time needed to settle medical disputes.

James said that the USAF plans to raise the retention bonus of unmanned aerial vehicle pilots from US$25,000 each year to US$35,000.


What bothers the USAF is that airline companies offer generous remunerations to poach pilots.


James said that it is imperative for the government to raise bonuses for air force pilots as the airliners "are expected to recruit more pilots".


Both James and David Goldfein, Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, want to improve the living quality of pilots.


Goldfein sighed that the shortage of pilots is a "crisis", and that "the U.S. is not naturally endowed with air dominance, but get it in battle."


Goldfein said although the current pilot shortage has not yet affected the country's operations in Iraq, Syria and Libya, these military operations have affected pilots' decisions to stay or leave.


There were some wrongdoings when the police carried out searches and arrests, including retaliatory law enforcement and connivance of police's irregularities against the law enforcement regulations.

According to the report, the police team comprising 2,600 people in Baltimore has received offensive training for a long time, leading to a mental state that "we are against them" when facing African Americans.


Currently the U.S. Department of Justice is in talks with the Baltimore Municipal Government to reach an agreement over reform of the city's police system.


The agreement covers police training, data collection, perfecting supervision and improving the relationship between police and the public.

Both the headcount of people having received punishment under the Party disciplines or the government disciplines and the number of punished cadres under the centralized management are the highest in the years since the reform and opening-up.


It is worth noting in the data that talk and letter inquiry have become important ways to deal with problem clues, amounting to 42,000 pieces (times).


Time-honored U.S. retailer Macy's said on August 11 (Local Time) that it will shut down 100 stores next year (2017), accounting for around 15% of the total.


The provincial government will launch a special inspection to ensure wellbeing of the 4.79 million disabled people in the process of realizing well-off life.


Involving one-fifth families across the province, the disabled represent a special social group that has a large number as well as big influence and requires special care.


Statistics of the latest household survey showed that there were 218,000 disabled people earning less than RMB 6,000 each year across our province, while the actual employment rate of urban and rural disabled people who were able to work differed greatly from the social average.

At around 8:30pm, she slid from a two-storey-high inflatable chute, while a young woman was standing at the foot of the chute.


Xiao Han failed to elude and ran into the woman. She cried out that her left leg hurt so much, and was later sent to the rest room by workers.


Xiao Han was sent to a hospital after her mother Mrs. Wu arrived, and was diagnosed with tibial fracture on her left leg.


Mrs. Wu contacted the person in charge of the water park, who came to hospital later and gave RMB 800 sympathy money. The responsible person said that the park bears no responsibility for the incident, which was unacceptable to her.


A reporter from Chutian Metropolis Daily visited the water park, and Mr. Lin, who was responsible for dealing with the incident, said he was on duty at the time of the accident.


According to his investigation, the security guard found no abnormalities on the slide at the time of the accident when Xiao Han cried out that her foot hurt. The security guard immediately helped her walk out of the pool and brought her Yunnan Baiyao.


Mr. Lin said Xiao Han told the security guard that her foot was sprained two days ago, and he didn't know how she had bone fracture.


The park stipulated that minors should enter the park with company of adult guardians, who should be fully responsible for the minors' safety.


The park shall not be held responsible for any safety accidents that took place due to personal reasons or poor care of the guardian, and a related notice was posted inside the park.


In view of this, lawyer Chen Liang from Hubei Dianheng Law Firm said that the park should be held responsible for the accident in terms of management no matter whether Xiao Han developed bone fracture after running into other people.


Even though the park posted the notice, it allowed Xiao Han to enter the park without company of a guardian, which could be deemed a wrongdoing.

At a media session held in Moscow on August 10, Putin slammed Ukraine for playing a "dangerous game", saying that currently it makes no sense for Russia and Ukraine to hold a peaceful dialogue over the situation in East Ukraine.


The statement said that Ukraine didn't sent staff to plot terrorist attack in Crimea, and no staff of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry was arrested there.


Ukrainian Chief of the General Staff and Press Secretary Seleznyov lambasted the practice of Russia as "provocation".


The website of Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko issued a statement, saying that Ukraine condemns terrorist acts that are carried out in all forms, and denied the adoption of terroristic means in Crimea.

The approval of the second batch of private banks peaked nationwide recently. Chongqing, Sichuan and Hunan successively set up their first private-funded banks.

Both the competent department and the initiating enterprises didn't give any details of the preparation scheme, including whether it differs from what's indicated in the notice.


The notice once indicated that the setup of Lanhai Bank should be filed with the CBRC for approval, and there may be adjustments in the process of application, examination and approval, which leads to uncertainties and risks.


The emergence of private banks will push the existing banks to change their development mode, which will sharply boost the efficiency of overall financial allocation.

Several suitcase theft cases have happened to foreign tourists in the express train bound for Kansai International Airport, Osaka, since last October, and police immediately strengthened their vigilance.


In April this year, the police successfully made an arrest of the thief when he was preparing to steal the suitcase of a Taiwanese tourist.


According to police investigation, this man carried out a total of 18 thefts from customers splashing out in shopping in Japan, involving a total case value of around JPY 4.2 million (approximately RMB 275,000).


A reporter asked that one Chinese fishing boat reportedly collided with a foreign cargo vessel at the waters about 70 kilometers northwest to China's Diaoyu Island today and both China and Japan sent official ships for search and rescue of the personnel overboard.


Currently six Chinese sailors have been saved, while official ships of the two countries are striving to search and rescue the other sailors.


According to the newspaper, many people would look forward to Perseids in midsummer evenings every year.


Reporters of Dahe Daily learned yesterday from the planetarium of the Henan Province women and children's activities center that the Perseids will reach its maximum from 9:00pm tonight to 1:30am on August 13 this year.


According to introduction of Li Defan, director of the planetarium, due to impact of gravitation from Jupiter, the peak flow of the Perseids will be higher than that of the previous years, which is expected to reach 150 meteors per hour.


Perseids is one of the three major meteor showers in the Northern Hemisphere, and is most suitable for observation.


"The view of meteor showers needs a place which is far away from light pollution in the urban area and has a starry sky."


Li Defan said Perseus is a well-known constellation in autumn's starry sky and will arise in the northeast in the evening of August 12, with meteors seemingly radiating from the Perseus to different directions.


Beijing will encounter showers or thunderstorms today (August 12), but the weather will remain hot. Citizens should take proper precautions before going out.


The highest temperature will hit 31℃ in Beijing during the day today. There will be showers or thunderstorms, but the sultry weather will continue.


Weather experts reminded that citizens should not take a lot of sports during sultry weather, and should drink more water to prevent heatstroke.


The drainage system of the Forbidden City has been precisely measured, designed and constructed when it was built.


Ground of the Forbidden City complies with characteristics of the geographical conditions in Beijing, appearing higher in the north and lower in the south while higher in the middle and lower on both sides. In addition, it is on a little down slope.


The elevation of the Gate of Divine Prowess to the north and the Meridian Gate to the south stands at 46.05 meters and 44.28 meters, respectively, generating a difference of about two meters in ground height. This slope has created advantages for natural drainage so that the ponding could drain slowly.


The Forbidden City's drainage system is very huge. The reserved ancient rain gutter measures more than 15 kilometers in length, while the subdrain is as long as nearly 13 kilometers.


All draining canals inside the Forbidden City lead to the Inner Golden Water River, which connects with a 52-meter-wide moat outside the Forbidden City, and is linked to the Outer Golden Water River and other water systems in Zhongnanhai.


Staff of the Forbidden City have replaced the damaged components in time in the overhauls and checks in a bid to guarantee a smooth drainage in rainy days.


The role of the two major foundations, which served as a message transmission pipeline across the Straits and between Taiwan and countries like the U.S. and Japan in the past, is believed to be more important before Chairperson and senior executives of the Straits Exchange Foundation were nailed down.


Chiu Chui-cheng made the remark when answering questions raised by reporters in the regular press conference of the Mainland Affairs Council yesterday afternoon.


He said that the Mainland Affairs Council has attached much importance to research results of the related think tank on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and will take them as a reference for "governance".


Yet, currently the top priority of Taiwan authorities is to carry out "sound official communication and interactions", in a push to maintain the existing mechanism across the Straits.


Chiu Chui-cheng added that public power issues, in particular, still need to be addressed through the dialogue and negotiation mechanism between public power and the authority for the best interest of Taiwan and the public.


In addition, as for co-launch of the Shanghai-Taipei City Forum, Chiu said urban communications and benign interactions across the Straits could help enhance understanding, and boost development of urban economy, education, culture and tourism.


The Mainland Affairs Council will keep a close eye on development of the communication, strengthen contacts with local governments and provide necessary assistance.


The reporter learned from China Railway that the bridge of the Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway across the Changchun-Shenzhen Expressway had a successful closure on August 12.


The Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway across the Changchun-Shenzhen Expressway is as long as 760 meters, and features complicated construction technology and high technical requirements. It is a dominant project of Liaoning section of the Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway.


All construction units and the vast railway builders have carried out construction in a scientific and innovative manner since the project was commenced in July 2014, ensuring the project to proceed safely and smoothly.


Closure of the bridge has laid a solid foundation for construction of the Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway to progress smoothly.


The Beijing-Shenyang high speed railway extends from the railway terminal in Beijing, and passes Chengde in Hebei Province as well as Chaoyang and Fuxin in Liaoning Province. It measures 698 kilometers in length.


"Even though there is a more than four-meter drop between the river and the bridge, water will flow over the bridge in the case of flash floods."


Jin Mingsheng, Deputy Town Chief of Luoerling Town, Huoshan County, made the remark while gesturing by the Xiangshui River on August 10.


"In the flood more than one month ago, the dam on one side of the river collapsed, with massive stones and washings rolling into the river.


We're now planning to infill the dam with cement, and the flood prevention bank will be solid enough to withstand the worst flooding in 50 years."


"Workers are moulding, and the project can be basically completed in another month", said Jin Mingsheng.


"Take this flood prevention bank for example, the dam may collapse at any moment when flood hits, and the flood would rush into houses of residents living along the bank. Now we use cement to infill a solid dam so that we could transfer residents along the bank with ease in the case of flooding in a bid to reduce property losses."


One of my hobbies is to buy, appreciate and collect books, and the collection of the initial issues of magazines is a growing special category in my study room.


Comrade Deng Xiaoping made the South Inspection Speech in the spring of 1992, pushing the new round of reform and opening-up to carry out in full swing in the country, and the cover of this magazine has well reflected the historical background of the year.


In the upper part of the cover, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is seen leaning forward to make strategic planning for the reform and opening-up campaign, highlighting his determination and last-ditch demeanor as a great man.


Beneath the cover, it is the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, which was under construction against the rising sun, and citizens are seen hustling for their work.


What I collect is the initial issues of magazines published during the country's two times of publication resumption after its founding. They reflect that Chinese workers are always in the forefront of the times, contribute to social development and lead progress of the times.


Data showed that currently Shennongjia receives around 700,000 visitors each year, while professional statistical analysis found that it is inadvisable for Shennongjia to receive more than 800,000 visitors each year, which may damage resources and environment of the scenic spot.


It is predicted that the number of visitors from home and abroad to Shennongjia will surge after it is inscribed to the World Heritage List, while Shennongjia made an early warning against the visitor number rather than blindly pursuing growth in the tourist number and income, which is laudable.


It is a necessary measure to protect the ecological environment of Shennongjia, and also a sustainable tourism road to realize the harmony between man and nature as well as man and resources in scenic spots.


After being made World Heritage, Shennongjia has become the first heritage site in China and the second across the world to obtain three major honors, namely, the World Heritage, the Man and Biosphere Reserve and the World Geopark.


In addition, Shennongjia forms the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Han River, and covers a total of four water systems, namely, Xiangxi River, Yandu River, Nanhe River and Duhe River.


The proverb that "Mountain foot and top always see different seasons - midsummer against spring or autumn against winter, with the four seasons being difficult to distinguish" has highlighted the unique and typical climatic features of Shennongjia.


Thereout, Shennongjia's practice of promoting sustainable tourism to protect ecological environment rather than pursuing overexploitation is worth learning and referring to by other World Heritage scenic spots.


Shennongjia stands out as the 50th World Heritage of our country, and China has become the second biggest country in terms of the number of World Heritage it secures. We shall strive to make the 50 World Heritages glow and pass them on to the future generations.


For the time being, many heritage sites have been found "taking the application seriously but making light of preservation and protection, taking the exploitation seriously but making light of management", turning the World Heritage into a cash cow.


Obviously, if the application for World Heritage is viewed from the economic perspective, a heritage will be taken as a "golden bowl", while its future will look grim no matter how good it is now.


There are many past experiences to learn from at home and abroad; for instance, six World Heritage sites in China received yellow card warning at the Session of the World Heritage Committee held in 2010 mainly due to the change of ecological environment after overexploitation.


Tang Jiagui, deputy chief of the animal management department at Chongqing Zoo, told the reporter that if a female panda gives birth to twins in the wild, it would usually choose to feed the stronger one but neglect or turn down the weaker one.


Now the baby pandas need to be fed every six hours, while they have to be separated when being fed, or else, their mum "Lan Xiang" will react defensively.


Ramos, a former Philippine president and a special envoy to China, wrapped up his visit to Hong Kong and returned to the Philippines by Philippine Airlines at around 1:00pm today (August 12).


Ramos made a statement before leaving Hong Kong, saying that he had a friendly and happy meeting with his old friends in Hong Kong, and they discussed how to advance peace and cooperation between the two countries as individuals.


He also euphemized that even though it was not an ice-breaking visit, it could bring a turnaround to the Sino-Philippines relations.


Ramos indicated in the statement that Fu Ying and Wu Shicun attended the meeting as individuals to have informal discussions.


China has expressed its welcome to Ramos' will of paying a visit to Beijing as a special envoy to China.


Ramos said that the Government of Philippines is willing to have a formal talk with the Chinese Government on issues of common concern at the right time.


Ramos also emphasized at the sum-up press conference that no concrete issues about disputes arising from the South China Sea were discussed during the meeting.


Ramos: We didn't cover the concrete issues about the South China Sea, except for the fair fishing rights, which we also mentioned in the statement.


Ramos also joked that even though it was not an ice-breaking visit to Hong Kong, it could bring a turnaround to the Sino-Philippines relations.


Ramos: Former Interior and Local Government Secretary Alunan said that this visit to Hong Kong was originally for the purpose of ice breaking, but it seemed that there was no ice to break in the summer in Hong Kong.


As for time of the next meeting, Ramos said it will be decided by the President Duterte as well as development of the situation. It will be held in September at the soonest, but the candidates have not been nailed down yet.


According to the announcement, Niger's capital Niamey and the Tillaberi region were severely affected by the flood, with rainstorm causing damages to massive infrastructure facilities including farmland, roads and bridges.


As part of the efforts to cope with the disastrous situation, the Nigerien Government allocated 326 tons of emergency relief food to aid people afflicted by the natural disaster, and planed to provide financial and technical support to the disaster-hit area.


Continuous rainfall and severe thunderstorms have dominated Yunnan in the first ten days of August.


The main urban area of Kunming saw several times of single-point heavy rainfall in early August, and the average rainfall stood at 82mm in the city, 48% higher than the same period in the past.


Yet, throughout the year, the average rainfall of Kunming by early August was still slightly smaller than that of the previous years.


At around 4:30pm on yesterday (August 11), a total of 39 regions in Yunnan received early warnings against meteorological disasters, and most of them were yellow warnings against thunderbolt.


The rainfall sustained across much of Yunnan, while some regions had thunderstorm, short-time strong rainfall, hail, gale and other severe convective weather.


Rainfall in the main urban area of Kunming decreased compared to the day before yesterday, and was not strong. The weather got warmer.


According to forecasts of the provincial meteorological observatory, the showery weather will sustain in Kunming in the coming three days, while the temperature will basically remain unchanged at between 17℃ and 26℃.


The municipal government approved it recently, requiring all related districts and counties as well as units to implement it to fully guarantee the life and property security of people along the river.


The "Chinese style of crossing roads" can be seen everywhere for a long time, and people have become accustomed to the phenomenon that pedestrians jaywalk and climb over railings recklessly.


The traffic police department will start capturing such traffic irregularities with the help of e-police from next Monday (August 15).


The e-police will take a total of three pictures of the pedestrian who touches the virtual induction coil, and the information will be entered into the "Road traffic offense system" after being reviewed and verified by man to penalize the two above-mentioned irregularities.


It is only when all traffic participants abide by the traffic laws and regulations that the urban traffic order problem could be fundamentally addressed.


The U.S. plans to test the THAAD system in 2017 over claim to intercept DPRK's missiles


ITAR-TASS quoted James Syring as saying that they had tested the Air Defense Advanced Mobile System (ADAMS) of the U.S. for intercepting short- and medium-range missiles in a few years.


"The system has passed all these tests, and now we plan to test the long-distance effect of these weapons."


As for the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) antimissile system by the U.S. in South Korea, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed its strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition.


We requested the U.S. and South Korea to immediately stop deploying the THAAD antimissile system, never take actions to lead to complicated regional situation and never do things detrimental to China's strategic security interests.


Windows of three neighbors were broken, and two great-grandmothers who came to dissuade him were pushed to the ground.


Recently this furious man was brought under control by police of the Nancheng police station in Anlu City in a timely manner.


After receiving report, police of the Nancheng police station in Anlu City took decisive measures to subdue Xiao Ming to prevent him from hurting the innocent.


Police investigations showed that Xiao Ming's parents have all been aged above 60, and the family rarely dealt with others, and thus the possibility of being induced by others to go whoring could be eliminated.


The police found through investigations that Xiao Ming was overly elated, and what he said and did was different from ordinary people. They learned after inquiring his family members that Xiao Ming has become indoorsy since one year ago, refusing to contact or communicate with others.


Police suspected that Xiao Ming's abnormal behaviors were due to mental disturbance caused by his long-term staying at home. Anlu mental health center diagnosed that Xiao Ming had developed mental disease.


Currently Xiao Ming has been sent by the related departments to the mental health center to receive free treatment.


The latest statistical data from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) showed that Germany had received a total of 240,000 refugees in the first seven months of this year, a sharp decrease from the number expected.


A large number of refugees from the Middle East and North Africa flooded into Germany in 2015, and more than 1 million refugees were registered in Germany in the year.


On August 11, WirtschaftsWoche quoted Weise, head of the BAMF, as saying that only 240,000 refugees have entered Germany year to date, far smaller than expectation.


Despite the drop in the number of refugees flooding into Germany, the BAMF still has an arduous task. Currently there are still around 500,000 asylum applications left unprocessed.


Even so, an increasing number of refugees have filed lawsuits against the BAMF, and some of the asylum applicants have waited for more than two years.


By the end of 2015, nearly 2,300 cases against "nonfeasance" of the BAMF had been filed.


Bank of Russia said that the growth was mainly attributable to reassessment of the market expectation on the country's economy.


The international reserves of Russia include foreign exchange reserves, gold reserves as well as the reserve positions and special drawing rights (SDRs) in the International Monetary Fund (IMF).


The international reserves of Russia are jointly controlled by the Russian government and the central bank of Russia, and are mainly used for dealing with economic risks.


The international reserves of Russia have been on the decline in recent years amid the downward economic pressure faced by the country due to the Western sanctions against Russia, coupling with the dropping international oil prices.


Hollywood blockbusters, which are well made, star-studded and hyped, have been featured in the film market in recent years. It seemed that all people are discussing them, and go to cinema to watch them together.


Then is it truly as we thought that blockbusters always rock the cinema and make a bundle of money?


Undoubtedly, the production costs of Hollywood blockbusters have been surging year by year, and the growth is even far beyond that of the inflation rate.


Data from Chart 1 showed that the number of Hollywood films, which were produced during the decade from 1995 to 2004 and cost over US$100 million, totaled 60.


While the figure surged to 197 during the 11 years from 2005 to 2015.


The sharp increase in film production number indicates a rising production cost on average, which has aroused alert of the industry.


Famous directors Spielberg and Lucas once criticized such phenomenon in a forum activity, saying that if this continues, the industry would "implode".


Among these 29 films, the highest proportion of marketing costs to total costs stood at 40%, while the lowest even reached as high as 24%.


The average costs of physical copy, production of audio and video products and transport reached US$67.8 million for each film.


It is very important to make a correct estimation of the number of copies and audio and video products to be made, especially in the DVD market that adopts the marketing policy of accepting goods return.


In 2005, DreamWorks made 5 million DVD copies of Shrek 2 but found a poor sales market, which made the company fail to realize its income target of the quarter as a result.


An average amount of US$36.6 million needed to be taken out from these 29 films for revenue sharing and compensation among directors, producers, scriptwriters, protagonists as well as other cast and crew.


For Hollywood studios, the revenue sharing mechanism could help them reduce financial pressure in the early stage, while it turns out to be an incentive for the cast and crew.


Among these 29 films, profitable ones shared 9% of income on average and one even shared as much as 18%, while films that suffered losses also shared around 5% of income on average.


It is noteworthy that the cast and crew would ask for share the "revenue" rather than the "profit".


Under operation of the tricky accounting system of Hollywood, some films that could have made a bundle may eventually turn out to be in the red.


For instance, a report revealed about Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix in 2010 indicated that Warner still claimed two years after distribution of the film that it lost US$167 million in the film, making profit sharing an empty talk.


Hollywood also needs to pay a certain amount of bonus to the union formed by various working staff, while these 29 films paid an average of US$11.76 million for that.


In addition, the operating costs of Hollywood Pictures would also be shared by films, while these 29 films shared an average of US$14.83 million.


After deducting the sales tax and gains shared by cinemas, the film company could receive 53% box office sales of the North America and 41% of the world, amounting to around US$169 million.


After an average marketing expense of US$98 million for distribution was deducted, there was only around US$70 million left.


These 29 films each generated an average income of US$134.3 million from distribution of home audio and video products.


After deducting the average marketing expense of US$21.9 million and production cost of US$30.5 million, the net income stood at US$81.9 million on average, which topped the income list. Its profit rate was much higher than that of theatrical distribution.


Paid TV channels created US$14.6 million of income on average for these films, a little bit more than the US$13.3 million created by free-to-air channels.


Among these 29 films, about half generated less than 1% of income from video on demand (VOD), and even films released after 2011 only generated 4.1% of income from this business.


Hollywood still took a relatively conservative attitude toward VOD when building the distribution system of these blockbusters.


As for derivative development, these 29 films generated an average income of US$11.5 million by authorizing derivative development.


Yet, almost two thirds of the derivative development income came from the top two super blockbusters, and only one third of them earned more than US$1 million from this.


Apart from the sources of income mentioned above, these Hollywood blockbusters still had bits of income from aircraft broadcast and music, which averaged at US$2.7 million at most for each film.


Surprisingly, Stephen's statistics showed that these 29 Hollywood blockbusters generated US$14.8 million of profits on average, while the profit rate only reached 3.7%.


If the long revenue recovery process is taken into account, this profit rate could hardly beat the inflation.


Films with costs in the lowest range between US$100 million and US$125 million delivered the worst performance in profitability, and only one third of them earned money.


However, three quarters of the films with costs in the highest range of above US$200 million made profits.


Core prompt: In 2014, Durant renewed his seven-year US$60 million contract with Nike by signing a ten-year contract worth US$300 million.

Japanese media said that Japan's foreign minister, Fumio Kishida, left for the Philippines to pay a visit on August 11 and held talks with Rodrigo Duterte, president of the country, to strengthen bilateral cooperation.


Both Japan and the US are eager to keep close touch with the Philippines in the fields including economic cooperation with the intention to prevent the Philippines from swinging to China.


According to the report of the website affiliated to Nihon Keizai Shimbun on Aug.11, Kishida will hold talks with Duterte and Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Perfecto Yasay, in Davao, a city in the south of the Philippines. This is the first talk held between a cabinet member of Japan and Duterte.


Kishida specially went to Davao City, base of Duterte, instead of Manila, the capital, so as to hope to confirm cooperative relationship with the Philippines on the issue of the South China Sea.


Kerry, on the second day after participating in a relevant conference of the ASEAN held in Laos in late July, met with Duterte in Manila. Both sides reached a consensus on the issue of respecting the arbitration ruling on the South China Sea.


Duterte told Kerry that "the arbitration ruling will constitute the base when any negotiation is conducted."


Kerry indicated at that time that $32 million would be offered to the government of the Philippines as assistance. It is probable that for the second time, Kishida will express the intention to offer assistance to the construction of the North-South commuter rail in Manila during the talks on August 11.


According to the report, the reason why both Japan and the US are eager to keep close touch with Duterte is that the Philippines is intensifying its effort to enhance the bilateral negotiation with China.


The US and Japan have been strengthening their cooperation with the Philippines. In 2014, the US and the Philippines signed a new military agreement, which, in fact, again permitted the American troops to station in the Philippines 25 years later, the report said.


Huang Xingguo and his party came to the environmental monitoring site at the scene of August 12 Accident to conduct an on-site observation of the surrounding environment and understand the monitoring data.


Since September 5 last year, particular pollutants in the air have not been detected and sea water quality has reached the national first-class sea water standard. Soil sampling test results indicate that there is no prominent difference in comparison with environmental background value.


Since March this year, monitoring has been conducted weekly. The monitoring results show that the environmental quality is safe and controllable, which is sufficiently affirmed by the experts from the Ministry of Environmental Protection who came to Tianjin to inspect the work.


The men's single gold medal of the table tennis at the Rio Olympics has made Ma Long realize the grand slam of his personal career.


Like spending a decade in grinding a sword, Ma Long candidly admitted that he was glad to realize his dream and paid a compliment to Zhang Jike, saying Zhang is both an opponent and brother and has become his model and motive force.


Though Ma Long rose to fame during his juvenile time, yet he is a late bloomer. Having experienced the men's single that made him to lose the luck to take part in the London Olympic Games, he finally won his first men's single gold medal of Olympics in Rio at the age of 28.


When interviewed after the match, Ma Long said that the gold medal is a "very good result" achieved in her career of so many years. "I'm very pleased to realize the dream of winning a gold medal after I have played table tennis for so many years."


The photograph shows the K210 train bound from Guangzhou to Ningbo. The conductor is introducing to foreign passengers Hangzhou special local products, for example, West Lake silk umbrellas, and talking about related knowledge of the G20 Summit.


With the G20 Summit in Hangzhou around the corner, the discussion about the preparation for this summit in Hangzhou is beginning to warm up on the Internet accordingly.


On August 10, president of the Philippines, Duterte again criticized Goldberg, US ambassador to the Philippines, for interfering in the internal affairs of the Philippines.


In this April, during the presidential campaign in the Philippines, on the pretext of the issue of human rights, Goldberg found fault with Duterte. Both sides continuously elucidated their own viewpoints and the speech conflict was intense.


Duterte expressed his strong dissatisfaction with Goldberg's interference in the presidential election and even threatened to sever the relationship with the US after he is elected as president.


On the 5th day of the month, Duterte raked up old stories and again expressed his dissatisfaction with Goldberg, criticizing the latter for interfering in the internal affairs of his country.


A press spokesman of the president of the Philippines once said that the president did not forget the suffering brought about by US-led Western colonists.


At the end of July, when US Secretary of State Kerry visited the Philippines, the masses gathered outside the US Embassy to the Philippines and held a mass rally. Carrying placards, they demanded that "American troops go away from the Philippines".


With a splendid civilization and numerous people, China stood at the forefront of the world development for several centuries. Now the country has become the second largest economy in the world.


Speaking of the word, we realize that it not only implies too much meaning but also carries rich contents.


Without doubt, the proposition of setting up cultural self-confidence is based on the sufficient identification of their own culture value as well as the firm confidence in its vitality on the part of the CPC and the Chinese people.


Many people have realized that in Xi Jinping's series of talks, articles, speeches and interviews, famous quotations from ancient Chinese books and records as well as classics are found everywhere, manifesting highly cultural self-confidence and arousing the widespread resonance all over the world.


Facts have proved that along with the rise of contemporary China, the influence and attraction of the Chinese culture is increasingly being strengthened.


The Chinese modern history of over 100 years has already told us that all the road, theory and system are rooted in the culture.


Of course, for a time, we learned from Western countries about their implements, systems and cultures and kept rethinking in this process.


After a long-term exploration, we have found that the firm confidence in China's modernization derives from the "spiritual gene" of the Chinese nation.


In Xi Jinping's speeches and investigations, the discussions on excellent traditional Chinese culture including Confucianism are beyond count.


In the 18th collective study of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, Xi Jinping all the more emphasized that China's today is just the development of her yesterday and the day before yesterday.


He also said that for several thousand years, the Chinese nation has taken her civilization development path different from those of other countries and nations.


We have not occasionally blazed the socialist road with Chinese characteristics, which is determined by the historical inheritance and cultural tradition of our country.


In 2010, China's GDP stood second in the world. However, China' achievements are more than economy.


Since the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has attached more prominent importance to the construction of a powerful socialist cultural country, dedicated to initiating a new "golden age" of cultural development.


Either excellent traditional culture, revolutionary culture or advanced socialist culture is demonstrating unprecedented vitality.


In spite of the fact that the Chinese culture is time-honored and has vigorous development momentum, it cannot be denied that its current influence and function are far from reaching its due height.


Though China has experienced a lost time in the past few hundred years, yet now she has returned to the world stage in a more powerful manner.

Recently, the Jiangning area has witnessed a new round of real estate price rise. In the latter half of the year, several developers of purely new commercial residential buildings entered the market for the first time, intending to charge the high price of 30,000 yuan per square meter.


And the initial average price of Country Garden Century City adjacent to Jiangning is 7,088 yuan per square meter. At present, the commercial houses in the first phase have been sold out.


In transportation, at present, the Jiangning area boasts Metro Line 1, Metro Line 3 and Arport Line S1.


Up to now, Country Garden Century City has accommodated scheduled buses to Xiaolongwan Metro Station and Pharmaceutical University Metro Station for proprietors. In the later phase, with the increase of proprietors who will live in the buildings, the number of scheduled buses to metro stations will be increased.


In addition, Country Garden Century City has the transportation facilities such as double high-speed rails and Lukou Airport.


In business, Jiangning is divided into seven business areas, such as Dongshan, Jiulong Lake, Baijia Lake, University Town, Sanshan, Chalukou and Heding Bridge, which are not far away from Country Garden Century City.

People are eagerly queuing up in lines for purchasing new delicately-decorated houses with housing area of 80 to 265 ㎡ each. Only 300 customers in the city can enjoy the extra 2% discount. Early registration means early selection of houses.


Another thing worth attention is that the range of the preferential railway tickets for college freshmen is between their homes and their universities. Otherwise, they cannot enjoy the preferential policy.


At the same time, a freshman, on the strength of his or her letter of admission, can only purchase a student ticket once. Those who have bought their tickets had better choose to alter the tickets if their journeys change instead of returning their tickets directly.


If they really need to return their tickets and ask for refunds, they can ask staff members to indicate that the tickets have been returned so as to ensure to purchase student tickets again.


Only a college entrant himself or herself can purchase a preferential railway ticket via his or her letter of admission. Other people accompanying him or her are not entitled to enjoy the discounted price.


"Though females are playing more and more social roles, quite a number of them lack the speech right equivalent to that of males in family and society at large."


The expert said that hence quite a number of females have the feelings of depression and anxiety to different degrees and the high-incidence age-bracket of such diseases is from 30 to 40.


Of course, in addition to the increase of the base number of patients, the increase of female patients stems from people's high attention to psychological health.


According to Xu Xiangdong, facing mental problems, many people in life adopt the attitude of "dogged resistance" or avoidance toward psychological pressure.


At the same time, due to the lack of understanding of depressive disorder and anxiety ailments, common citizens erroneously think that patients are in a fit of pique instead of giving them timely understanding and emotional support, which is also the main reason for a lower outpatient rate.


"Today, with people's getting a proper understanding of psychological health and paying attention to mental health, many patients and their family members can face the disease in a right manner."


Xu Xiangdong said that as a result, more and more patients are willing to enter hospitals to accept the help of professionals.

After returning to the local police station, the policeman first of all offered a bowl of mung bean soup to the old man and told the latter to drink it up for fear that he might suffer heatstroke due to being exposed to the scorching weather for a long time.


Afterwards, the policeman patiently talked with the old man. At last, he knew that the old man surnamed Chen is 86 years old, a villager of the village of Nanzhai, Xiazhang Town. Due to his old age, the old man was not sober enough so that he could not find his home as he was wandering.

At dusk on August 9, a group of scaffolders working in high-altitude environment were quietly sitting on the steps of Optical Valley Pedestrian Street to have a rest.


Also called daily-salary workers, the scaffolders employed by their boss received their salary on the site after completing their work that day.


The city with more and more high rises cannot do without the efforts made by the scaffolders. Their work, which seems to have no technical content, is very dangerous.


On the morning that day, wearing work clothes and safety helmets, with wrenches in their waists and bolt guns in their hands, they shuttled on the steel frame outside buildings.


While talking, Xiong Guoyin from Huangpi took out 1500 yuan, his three days' pay, saying that he was going to send the money to his wife.


It is known that each of the daily-salary workers can earn 300 yuan to 500 yuan a day according to his labor intensity.


An experienced scaffolder deals with about 120 steel tubes every day, each of which weighs 8 kg. In other words, each scaffolder does with steel pipes weighing as much as 1000 kg a day.


With the construction duration coming to an end, Master Wu who is over 50 years old was counting his money, saying that he could endure the hardship in order to let his family lead a better life. Speaking of his family, he chuckled.


Tomorrow morning, the Municipal Public Security Bureau will hold the activity of soliciting opinions from citizens on the improvement of the traffic environment on the square of the railway station.


However, as a window showcasing the image of Xi'an to the outside world, there are still a lot of unsatisfactory phenomena as far as the traffic environment around the railway station is concerned.


At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, the Municipal Public Security Bureau of Xi'an will solicit opinions from citizens and conduct on-site interactive communication with them.


The interested citizens who cannot conduct the on-site communication can dial the hot-line specially opened at the branch bureau of public security of the station.


Known as the sternest anti-corruption law in the history of the Republic of Korea, the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act will come into force next month. According to the law, the expenses per capita of a civil servant who accepts a banquet shall not exceed 30,000 Korea won (approximately RMB 181 yuan)


According to the report by Yonhap on August 10, this stipulation poses a challenge to many first-class Korean restaurants that were originally going to exclusively entertain political figures and senior civil servants.


Quite a number of restaurants have to adjust the standard of table money and promote more inexpensive set meals. Some restaurants have closed down or switched to other industries once and for all.


Many Korean restaurant bosses are worried about their future business because of the law, Yonhap reported.


In Insadong of Seoul, a restaurant which has been doing business since 1969 is often patronized by political figures, government officials, media reporters and merchants.


The boss of the restaurant told the reporter from Yonhap that for many years they have been proud of offering luxury food and private dining environment to customers.


In the past ten years, the restaurant has offered high-specification set meals. However, "in order to satisfy the upper limit of table money set by The Improper Solicitation and Graft Act, we will have to change the tradition of several decades, which is really a difficult decision."


"Charcoal Fire Barbecue Village" mainly offers beef barbecue. According to its general manager, the price of "Han-u" (Korean beef), a signature dish of the restaurant, is over 50,000 Korean won.


"We predict that from October on, the sales volume will greatly reduce so we are considering replacing Han-u in set meals with imported beef."


Located in Jongno district, Seoul, the restaurant which was well-known for the patronage by political VIPs such as former presidents Roh Tae-woo and Lee Myung-bak closed down last month.


The boss of the restaurant said that as partial Korean government departments have been moved to Sejong, the restaurant's volume of business has suffered a great shock. It is estimated that after the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act takes effect, the number of guests will be even smaller.


Before long, the restaurant will divert to engaging in Vietnam rice noodles and the per capita dining standard is around 10, 000 Korean Won (RMB 60 yuan).


According to the prediction of the Korean Catering Service Industry Association, in the first year after the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act is put into force, the income of hotel industry in S. Korea will reduce by 4.15 trillion Korean Won (RMB 25 billion yuan) year on year.


Facing the possible economic loss, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said at a cabinet conference on the 10th day that what is important is to reduce its negative effects as far as possible while sticking to the core part of the Improper Solicitation and Graft Act.


She said, "Once the law is put into force, the social transparency and fairness will be more or less improved and the efficiency in economy will increase, too. Therefore, the economic growth of S. Korea will speed up."


While driving vehicles in our daily life, we often go through tunnels, sometimes even super-long tunnels or tunnel groups. So, whether tunnels are safe is important to us.


Meanwhile, it is stipulated that no unit or individual shall destroy, damage, illegally occupy or take advantage of highway tunnels and their subsidiary facilities.


If traffic needs to be closed or a carriageway is occupied for a long time due to the maintenance project, except for emergency situation, the management and maintenance unit shall issue to the public the information of construction and traffic control together with the traffic police department 15 days ahead of time.


Many drivers have encountered the situation in which traffic jams took place in tunnels. Some drivers are accustomed to smoking cigarettes in a tunnel to kill time.


When a highway tunnel is experiencing traffic congestion in the form of vehicles queuing, the traffic police department should take measures such as preventing vehicles from entering, guiding and diverting the traffic according to specific situations and issue the information of traffic jam in a timely way.


When a traffic accident takes place, it is imperative to carry out traffic control immediately to keep secondary accidents from happening through measures such as patrol and propaganda.


The public security organ can designate the route and the time for vehicles loaded with dangerous chemicals to pass or prohibit such vehicles from passing according to the requirements of the safety protection of highway tunnels and the technical conditions of highway tunnels and issue the notice to the public.


According to chinanews.com on August 12, Sheng Laiyun, press spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said today that the surveyed urban unemployment rate in Liaoning is higher than the national average level. Since its economy is experiencing adjustment, the interior pressure is rather big.


Today, the Information Office of the State Council held a press conference with regard to the operation of national economy in July 2016.


Judging from the over-all situation, since the international economy is under deep adjustment, its recovery is relatively slow, which will bring about a large pressure on China's import including the import of Liaoning province.


Domestically, as China is in the critical period of structural adjustment, the contradiction between the surplus of traditional industries and the inadequacy in the growth of market effective demand is rather acute and the throes caused by the adjustment of traditional industries are still being released.


Therefore, in this new round of adjustment, it is the price of the products of heavy and chemical industries that is undergoing the deepest adjustment, thus inevitably bringing downward pressure on the economy of Liaoning.


During the 12th Five-Year Plan, due to the development of urbanization and the expansion of the real estate, the development of infrastructure in Liaoning was sound and the base of its real estate was fairly high.


After entering the period of the 13th Five-Year Plan, since its original base number was high, in terms of data manifestation, this round of adjustment has much more been reduced than other region.


Sheng Laiyun summarized that the economic adjustment of Liaoning has its special economic reasons, including not only the influence of cyclical factors, but also that of structural factors and even that of base effect and that generally it is in the process of adjustment.


Sheng Laiyun also revealed that since its economy is being adjusted, the fact that the urban unemployment rate of Liaoning is higher than the national average level indicates that its interior pressure is rather big.


According to the observation of the data in the recent two months, there is an indication that the economy of Liaoning will be stabilized and the index reduction degree is becoming narrow.


We believe that through the joint efforts of all aspects, the economy in the northeastern region including Liaoning will display the vitality of the former old industrial base for the second time.
