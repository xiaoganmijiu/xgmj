and strive to create a new dimension in the work of NPC. To achieve this, it should, on one hand, understand that the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee was the supreme principle of the party's leadership


and unswervingly adhere to the centralized and unified leadership of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core. On the other hand, it should comprehend thoroughly The Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era proposed by Xi Jinping.

Responsible comrades of the National people's Congress and the Ministry of Public Security took part in the swearing-in.


To interpret the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress, the people in Jiangxi Gao'an developed an intuitive understanding of the spirit and essence of the 19th CPC National Congress through a knowledge contest.


In Fujian Province, a light cavalry team of propaganda was organized and established, going down to countryside fields and seaside fishing villages to propagate the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress in both local dialect and mandarin,


to answer questions and resolve doubts for local villagers on the spot, and brainstorm on how to help the grass-roots get rid of poverty. In the 19th CPC National Congress report, General Secretary proposed Six Precisions and emphasized ensuring the basic life needs of a group of poor people through social security.

At the construction site of the eco-friendly power station in Chengdu, Sichuan, experts from the Chengdu University of Technology College of Environment and Civil Engineering are explaining to the workers


a section in the report about about advancing green development and building a beautiful China.


White clouds dot a blue sky now. There are more days with white clouds than that of a few years ago. So, in the 19th CPC National Congress, we have also proposed to win


the war to protect our blue skies. Chengdu has completed the construction of three eco-friendly power generation projects, with daily waste treatment capacity of 6000 tonnes.


The power generated would meet the demand of nearly 750,000 households, and save 250,000 tonnes of coal.


The report delivered by General Secretary Xi in the 19th CPC National Congress has truly struck a chord in the hearts of our people.


I have listened carefully to the report and noticed that our people have been mentioned 203 times, and cultural development 72 times by General Secretary Xi.


Meanwhile, the report has mapped out a comprehensive plan to advance Chinese Dream and the overall development of socialist cultural quality.


After coming back from his performance in Shandong, Meng Guanglu, the delegate to the 19th CPC National Congress and head of Tianjin Youth Peking Opera Troupe


organized his entire troupe to learn the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress.


We should take root among the masses and serve the people, we should come up with fine works and align with the central government from thought to soul. Eulogizing our socialist


cultural confidence is of great significance not only to the cultural confidence of our cultural workers but also to the entire Chinese people.


The report of the 19th CPC National Congress points out,


we must promote the creative evolution and development of fine traditional Chinese culture, see our revolutionary culture remains alive and strong, and develop an advanced socialist culture. We should cherish our cultural roots, draw on other cultures, and be forward-thinking.


We should do more to foster a Chinese spirit, Chinese values, and Chinese strength in order to provide a source of cultural and moral guidance for our people.


The day after the Congress was concluded, Zhang Jian, a delegate of the 19th CPC National Congress and prima ballerina of the National Ballet of China,

We have been making efforts.


So in the following five years, we should continue to create works that belong to our nation and which reflect the humanistic spirit of the socialism for a new era.


Therefore, we should display the era adequately in our works.


According to the latest news, the People’s Daily for tomorrow will publish a commentary, saying we should make a greater contribution to mankind as well as learn and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress from eight perspectives.


The article points out, the 19th CPC National Congress takes the following as its mission, using new thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, and addressing problems for mankind.


In this way, the dreams of Chinese people and those of the people all over the world will reinforce each other and continue to usher a new situation for great power diplomacy with Chinese characteristics.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media diet.


Others have tried and failed.


Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.


If so, he will be the first.


Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even keel.


Here's a bit from reporter Josh Dawsey:


"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on his first day at work, he outlined a key problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the president's hands.


Kelly told the staff that information needed to flow through him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if given good information."


Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried and failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.


President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still going strong.


"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.


Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady stream of praise."


Okay.


But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is laughable.


Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of us don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.


We'll probably never know about tweets that Trump didn't send.


If his staffers managed to him out of trouble even a few times, then their efforts were worthwhile.


But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from stirring up controversy.


Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presenting Trump with material - which may or may not be reliable - that promotes their worldviews.


Politico - all over this story - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the president.


This was one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:


"Current and former Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negative press clips, especially those with damaging leaks, becoming engrossed in finding out where they originated.


That is what happened in late February when someone mischievously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'the source behind a bunch of leaks' in the White House.


No matter that Johnson had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he offered no concrete evidence or that he had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.


Trump read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."


Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."


How'd that work out?


Kelly is trying to do the same thing, three months later.


Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his aides are still vying for influence.


Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficult.


Tourism charm town: How does charm mesmerize tourists


[Abstract] The potential of small towns in Zhejiang is gradually unleashed.


Today, these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to Zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery, savor Zhejiang culture, and feel nostalgic about Zhejiang. They will also become key drivers to help the Province create “Picturesque Zhejiang”, China’s most beautiful tourist destination.


Reputed for Local Custom


"Village theatrical performance is staged as the moon rises, while the pleasant smell of delicious sausage spreads with breeze."


Walking through the Anchang Ancient Town in Shaoxing, you can see hoop buckets, bamboo knitting, ironmaking, shoes stitching, lace making, cotton spinning and other traditional handicraft techniques almost everywhere, which fully represent the intangible cultural heritage of the Anchang Ancient Town. Tourists all over the world are enchanted to experience the folk customs and feel the atmosphere of Shaoxing's historical and cultural experience.


It is reported that during the three-day New Year's holiday, more than 65,000 tourists visit Anchang Ancient Town.


In Zhejiang, a town with a unique style such as Anchang Ancient Town is scattered all over like stars. The glittering waves of Jiaxing Xitang is flowing with the warmth and gratefulness of the lower reaches of the Yangze River in the south; the white walls of Quzhou's Nianbadu Ancient Town convey to us the changes over time in the town; and the murals of fishermen in Shitang, Taizhou draw a picture of their life, both traditional and modern. These towns are the "palm treasure" of Zhejiang tourism and also the favorites of tourists from all regions.


In recent years, with the promotion of tourism construction throughout the whole region, the potential of Zhejiang’s small towns have been gradually awakened.


In 2016, the provincial government office issued the "The implementation of the creation of a tourist town in Zhejiang Province”, which proposed that the province would accept and name about 100 tourist towns with strong folk customs, beautiful ecological environment and rich tourism industries after 5 years or so.


Today, these little towns have become key destinations for visitors to Zhejiang who come to admire the natural scenery, savor Zhejiang culture, and feel nostalgic about Zhejiang. They will also become key drivers to help the Province create “Picturesque Zhejiang”, China’s most beautiful tourist destination.


The responsible people of the Provincial Tourism Bureau established that with the rise of these tourism style towns, we must now pay more attention to the construction of the personalized tourism industry and new tourism projects and formats emerging one after another. These have brought rich experiences to tourists and earned glowing reputations.


Emphasis on promotion


Recently, directed by the Zhejiang Provincial Tourism Bureau and Zhejiang Daily Press Group, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group hosted the “Towns × Future artists" sharing session and the 2017 promotion season of Zhejiang style tourism towns, "Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”. The closing ceremony took place in the Zhejiang exhibition hall.


“A style town has artistic beauty and living warmth.


The style of the towns lies in the original sense, flavor and township, which represents the original purity.


Xie Hanfeng, a teacher at the School of Film and Television Animation Arts of China’s Academy of Art, the domestic A-list film and television advertising director, and Professor Xu Xianghong, the dean of the School of Art and Communication at China Jiliang University, talked about the cross-border stories of towns through Towns in the lens and Reconstruction of small village.


Many scenic tourist towns in Zhejiang have deep cultural resources. Dong Xinjian, a town deputy from Nanxun, Huzhou, appeared in the site in person and interpreted Nanxun as a traditional Chinese painting.


The style of towns in the south of the lower reaches of the Yangze River have been popular with painters since ancient times. Nowadays, the Nanxun Ancient Town is developing in-depth cooperation with art academies such as the China Academy of Art.


Tourism style towns must be equipped with elements of style, tourism, service and the environment.


Among these, tourism service facilities and the environment are very important.


If the tourists are handed in an umbrella on a rainy day, they can better experience the town’s style.


In the era of sharing, the Tourism Full Media Center of the Zhejiang Daily Press Group teamed up with the hottest shared umbrella company to customize a number of shared umbrellas in “Poetic Zhejiang” style, hoping to promote the concept of “Sharing and Green”, spread the awareness of civilized tourism and public morality among tourists and residents, and create a shared, beautiful tourist environment.


This has become a bright spot in the 2017 promotional season of Zhejiang’s tourism towns, "Poetic Zhejiang, Towns with folk customs”.


Expecting wonders


Up to now, Zhejiang Province has released the list of the first 21 provincial-level tourism towns that will ultimately culminate in a grand total of 115 provincial tourism towns.


As the prior area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Five-Year Plan” period, the style towns will eventually be built into tourist attractions with a grade of 3A or higher, becoming a new model for tourism product diversity, tourism benefits and industrial integration.


What makes tourism style towns attractive is their authenticity and originality.


The beauty of the tourism style towns not only stems from the misty bridges and rivers, but also from a long history of cultural tradition; the revitalization of the country is due to cultural self-confidence.


Throughout the world, the tulips of the Netherlands’ Lisse Town, the salt of Austria’s Hallstatt Town, and the pumpkins of Pumpkin Town in France, have been attracting a large number of tourists from all over the world each year. This has allowed the realization that tourism could help the economic growth of smalls towns as well.


For the style towns, the point “Emphasis on characteristics and retention of nostalgia” has given the towns a distinct personality and soul, further providing cultural permeation, carrying local cultural traditions, and highlighting native civilizations.


Tourism style towns, with culture and nostalgia as the link and humanities and scenery as the carrier, connect tourists all over the world while inherit and innovate the traditional customs and cultures in the co-construction and sharing process.


Essentially speaking, the tourism style town is a complex open-style tourism area, and it should be a shared living space for local residents, exotic tourists and even sojourners.


As the main battlefield for tourism growth in the future, tourism style towns will change the rural ecological landscape, economic and social development patterns, and the flow direction of industrial factors. Additionally, they will play an important role in eliminating the urban-rural infrastructure gap, hastening rural cultural recovery.


In the wake of accelerating revitalization of the countryside, Zhejiang tourist towns will receive a more abundant and wonderful story.


Figures indicate that 70% of China’s travel demand is concentrated within a 3km radius. On this basis, the short-distance travel market will become a bike sharing paradise sooner or later.


A report in “The Nikkei” claimed that inflationary pressure will increase because of the expansionary fiscal policies of the next Trump administration. The pace of interest rate hikes will also accelerate in 2017.


The annual International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), held between January 9 (January 10, Beijing time) and 12, opened in Las Vegas, USA.


According to the list of exhibitors published by the official CES website, the 51st CES attracted 4,577 corporate participants from around the world.


Compared to the massive 13,000 TV dramas broadcast by satellite TV each year, these “terminated dramas” are but a drop in the ocean.


Travellers negotiate trench, return to 'Millionaire's row'


Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are again at loggerheads with determined travellers who have negotiated a council-dug trench to reclaim a field outside their mansions.


The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull dubbed 'millionaire's row'.


Bringing horses, babies and an army of vans, they have returned after being kicked out only in May, undeterred by a moat dug by the council to prevent their incursions.


The tactful group found a gap in the defences, squeezing their vehicles though a section left unbarricaded to accommodate a pathway.


Furious residents have savaged Solihull Council saying it was 'useless at dealing with the problem'.


One anonymous resident said: 'They moved there on Monday night after being moved on from Bentley Heath where they were throwing rocks at passers by.


The council needs to be shamed into action as they are useless at dealing with the problem.


The travellers were there in May, were moved on and now they are back again.


More arrived last night, probably even more today.'


She added: 'Birmingham council knows how to deal with this by getting long injunctions to protect their parks.


I live on Streetsbrook road and I'm not happy to continue paying my council tax when the council can't even stop this.'


One local resident who did not wish to be named said: 'It is ridiculous, we have only just seen the last round of these travellers leaving, only to be blighted by another round.


The numbers have increased this time and a horse has even been seen grazing on the parkland.'


A spokeswoman for Solihull Council said: 'We are aware of an unauthorised encampment on land off Streetsbrook Road and working alongside Solihull Police, we are undertaking the necessary legal actions to move them on as quickly as possible.


To support our evidence gathering it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.


This helps build a picture of the situation for the court to consider when we present our case to them.'


The Fifth Session of the 12th National People's Congress held its closing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on March 15.


This is an interview with Ma Junsheng, Director-General of the State Post Bureau.


Xinhua News Agency/Chen Yehua/CRI Online: The Fifth Session of the 12th National People's Congress held its closing ceremony at the Great Hall of the People at 9am on March 15.


Prior to the closing ceremony, Ma Junsheng, Director-General of the State Post Bureau, expressed during an interview at the “ministers’ passage” that the State will strengthen supervision over prominent issues that currently exist in the express delivery industry such as late delivery and loss of or damaged parcels, and guide and enhance self-discipline in the industry.


Ma Junsheng said that efforts to resolve four major prominent issues in the express delivery industry will be enhanced this year. The development of the express delivery industry in China has entered the express lane.


In 2012, express delivery volume in China stood at 5.6 billion items, and at least 10,000 express delivery three-wheelers were deployed. A single standard, a unique logo and a unified insurance were implemented, which facilitated delivery and ensured safety.

Italy toughens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats


Italy has warned NGOs operating migrant rescue boats in the Mediterranean they will not be allowed to continue if they do not sign up to new rules governing their operations.


"If NGOs do not sign up to a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue operating," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.


Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities impounded a boat operated by German aid organisatiion Jugend Rettet on suspicion its crew effectively collaborated with people traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.


The aid organisation, which has only been operational for a year, declined to comment on the substance of detailed allegations made against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.


"For us the rescue of human life is and will be our top priority, so we are very sorry we will not be able to operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.


"We can only assess all the accusations currently being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."


Italian authorities had been monitoring Jugend Rettet's boat, the Iuventa, since October.


Its crew is suspected to taking on board dinghy loads of migrants delivered directly to them by people traffickers and allowing the smugglers to make off with the vessels to be used again.


At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the contents of which were published by Italian media.


The crew are suspected of having flouted the authority of the Italian coastguard, which oversees rescue operations in the zone, out of humanitarian zeal rather than for any other motives.


Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa would notably have to have an Italian police officer on board monitoring their activities.


Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.


The latter said on Thursday it regarded the new rules as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not involve any "significant change or impediment" to its rescue operations.


Among those who have refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organisation Doctors Without Borders (MSF).


Minniti meanwhile said a sharp fall over recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy following rescues was an indication that efforts to beef up the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors was bearing fruit.


"In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.


He revealed plans for further talks this month with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.


Lian Ping, Chief Economist of the Bank of Communications, said that as value added of industry for each of the first three quarters of 2017 was stronger toward the end of the quarter, the growth rate of value added of industry in December could accelerate to 6.6%.


Cumulative growth rate of fixed asset investment in December is forecast to be at 7.2%, unchanged from the previous month, but lower than that a year ago.


Industrial production, while weaker than that in October, will remain generally unchanged from that in November.


Investment in China’s manufacturing sector was low in December, but infrastructure investment improved slightly. As such, fixed asset investment for the month will remain the same as that in November.

Beijing’s new measure to “shift and relocate institutions of higher learning”: 10,000 BUCT teachers and students move into new campus at Changping


The opening ceremony of Beijing University of Chemical Technology’s (BUCT) new campus was held at the Changping District of Beijing on the 2nd, and school officially commenced at the 1,800 mu green campus.


Reporters learned from the ceremony that for the purposes of enhancing the capital’s core functions, and treating “large urban center diseases”, on the back of cooperative development among Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province as well as the shifting and relocation of non-capital related functions, Beijing has accelerated the program to shift and relocate institutions of higher learning situated in central districts to suburban districts in recent years. The teachers and students of some institutions of higher learning are relocating in batches to new campuses in Shunyi, Daxing, Fangshang and other suburban districts.


BUCT’s new campus is located in Nankou Town, Changping, and sits on a land area of 1,800 mu, some 40 km from the city. It is a key project of Beijing’s shifting and relocation of non-capital functions.


The new campus was constructed in three phases. Phase I is now entirely completely, and Phase II is expected to commence by the end of the year. On completion, the learning and living requirements of close to 20,000 undergraduate and graduate students as well as faculty staff are expected to be met.


At this time, a review of this year’s film market will show that fans of the original book of a film adaptation and those of the actors taking part in film have become key components of the expected audience of the film.


At 17:10 today, the 119 command center at Shaoyang received an emergency call. Tetrahydrofuran stored at Hongzhi Chemical Plant at Longxutang, Shuangxi District, caught fire.


Shaoyang fire station immediately dispatched five detachments and 20 fire trucks with heavy chemical protective clothing, chemical cleaning vehicles and other equipment to the scene.


Preliminary investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was the small tanks in which tetrahydrofuran was stored. There was thick smoke at the scene.


At the time of filing this report, firefighters were in the processing of carrying out emergency rescue. The City’s health, safety administration, environmental protection, public security, traffic and other departments arrived at the scene successively. No fatalities or injured persons were found.


Michelle Carter sentenced for texts urging suicide of Conrad Roy


A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.


Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her term behind bars and five years of probation.


Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on 13 July 2014.


Mr Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.


My son was my best friend."


Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.


She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal team argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness.


Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood tearfully with hands clasped and eyes cast down as she was sentenced.


"Her actions killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.


"She ended his life to better her own.


She has not accepted responsibility," she said.


"She has shown no remorse."


But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible circumstance that she completely regrets."


However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or level of maturity or even her mental illness have any significant impact on her actions."


A prosecutor read a statement from Mr Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying there was "not one day I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.


I want him to be proud of me and how I am handling everything - I am trying to be there for his sisters in all of my pain we will carry with us for eternity," it said.


Mr Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was "haunted" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.


"Not having that one person I've been with every day since birth is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.


The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that criminalises telling a person to commit suicide.


Carter was 17 when Mr Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.


The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.


"Hang yourself, jump off a building, stab yourself I don't know there's a lot of ways," she said in several messages sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family.


In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You need to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy."


Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Mr Roy's death, ordering that she not be allowed to profit from the case through any press.


The case has divided legal opinion.


Among the few to defend Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before she was cleared two years ago.


Ms Knox, 30, published an op-ed in the Los Angeles Times saying: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."


Zhang Yimou is destined to controversial film artist. From when he began filming his first movie, “Red Sorghum”, he has always been a trendsetter in Chinese films, but he has also received a lot of criticism.


On the 2nd, reporters learned from Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Club that the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team came in fourth at the National Youth Basketball League Finals held in Beijing.


Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Youth Team is comprised of 11 local basketball players, and its head coach is Tsering Samdup, the assistant coach of the Lhasa Pure Land Basketball Men’s Team.

The players’ self-confidence and grasp of the game have increased significantly. Their exchanges with other teams were also more comprehensive, and exchanges both on and off the court have also increased and were more relaxed.


After the competition ended, captain Jiang Cuo said that he hoped to gain experience from taking part in the competition, and do his best for Tibetan basketball.


It is understood that during the competition, the players had to overcome factors such as low altitude sickness, displaying the image of Tibet.


The fact that track and field involves the most gold medals in the Olympics makes those athletes confident a lot, the famous players have been disadvantaged in the competition.


Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles as Carmakers Face Backlash


A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.


The BMW chairman said the company believed "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions," referring to the European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.


Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.


None of the companies described the moves as recalls.


European carmakers have heavily promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet rules on carbon dioxide emissions.


But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens, and can cause asthma.


The cost to automotive companies of installing equipment to neutralize the fumes emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.


As German automakers face scrutiny, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel has also been accused of coddling the powerful car companies and of ignoring signs of the problem.


The companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, which covered up its use of so-called defeat devices that could adjust emissions to comply with regulations when a car was being tested, but ease back in normal driving conditions.


Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.


Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.


The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian, and therefore is not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.


Early this year, Audi was swept up into a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to evade emissions rules in Europe, broadening an inquiry that had focused on the United States.


The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury carmaker accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profit.


Taking a couple of years, or even a few years, to make a film from planning to release is nothing unusual.


“Big Fish & Begonia”, an animated feature film 12 years in the making, recently announced that it would be released on July 8th.


Liang Xuan, the author of “Big Fish & Begonia”, dropped out of his studies at the Department of Thermal Engineering at Tsinghua University when he was 21, and founded B&T together with best friend Zhang Chun. In 2008, Ce Yuan Ventures provided US$1 million in risk investment, kick-starting the maiden animated film, “Big Fish & Begonia”.


The film was already a recipient of multiple local and overseas awards at the creative sample stage. It has been included in the Centre Pompidou’s collection and acclaimed as “an outstanding artwork”.


As it took six years from creation to production, the film was known as a “super deceiver” by millions of fans who were looking forward to its release.


“Big Fish & Begonia” is a Chinese fantasy. The announcement of the trailers for the scheduled release has once again led to new expectations among all viewers.


Liang Xuan said, “I’ve only done this one thing in the last 12 years. Now it has turned from a dream into reality. I’m both nervous and excited”.


Zhang Chun said, “I kept thinking of using one-fiftieth of other people’s budget to come up with an image effect that was completely identical to these other people’s. I drove our entire team up the wall.”


Dongguan, the “Factory of the World” which once made its fortune on industrial processing and large numbers of general workers, is looking to high-level talent to help the city reposition itself.


The Dongguan government recently held a high-level talent week event. Reporters from China Business Network noticed a number of reputable local enterprises participating in the talent fair.


On the bright advertising board against a tangerine colored wall, they listed their respective exorbitant price tags.


Therefore, China Television Drama Production Industry Association will work together with the television drama production industry nationwide to sign a self-discipline convention.


Provence lavender under threat from climate change


It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it's under threat from climate change.


Lavender is in decline because of drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing a major headache for scientists and farmers attempting to find solutions.


Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is effectively endangered, because in recent years the plant has been subjected to the effects of climate change that brought a lot less rain in the spring and mostly in the autumn.


This affects the lifespan of lavender.


There's also a small cicada, a micro-bacteria transmitting leaf hopper, and in very dry weather there are lots of them."


And a lot is at stake.


As well as attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is highly sought after for perfume and cosmetics.


Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a number of large flowers, we have smaller ones, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.


So we have fewer parts with essential oil."


Solutions being looked at include better water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and developing varieties more resistant to dry conditions.


Compared to the sci-fi elements in the movie, the two lead actors said that it was the movie’s plot that attracted them.


On the afternoon of September 5, West China City Daily reporters consecutively interviewed numerous renowned personalities in the cross talk circle, as well as two cross talk artistes. What was surprising was that they were unanimously silent most of the time.


One is a Silver Bear Best Actor, the other, an up-and-coming young actor; “Guilty of Mind” is the first partnership between Liao Fan and Li Yifeng.


A journalist's murder underscores growing threat in Mexico


The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meets on Wednesdays to review their plans for coverage of the most recent mayhem wrought in Sinaloa state by organized crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars.


But on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they've come together to talk about security.


It's important to change their routines, they are told.


Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children with them to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or to leave them at home.


Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: adversaries, neutrals, allies.


They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.


There are drug-traffickers, politicians, businesspeople, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalog of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos perilous.


There is no respite from the violence, and as bodies pile up across the country, more and more of them are journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 under federal protection after attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven dead in seven states.


Among the latest is their editor and inspiration, Riodoce co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.


"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on narco-violence.


His absence is felt deeply, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying his middle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that display his smiling, bespectacled face or his trademark Panama hat.


The workshop takes place less than two months after his death; the reporters discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.


Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to handle the journalists' cases, it has only prosecuted two, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.


As with most of the thousands of murders tied to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.


At Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.


Without information on the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security, says Ibarra, is of little use.


"It's very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says.


"As long as we don't know why, you distrust everyone."


On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital of Culiacan.


He managed to drive just a couple blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was forced out of his car and shot 12 times, presumably for the name of the paper - which translates as Twelfth River.


The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.


Valdez was 50 years old.


He left a wife and two adult children.


Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.


But on the subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.


Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.


Never mind that someone or several people are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings, larger than many homes for the living.


Forget for a minute that a state of "calm" is when just one cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.


Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is wracked with guilt for failing to protect his friend.


He believes two errors contributed to the killing.


First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.


The piece may have angered the sons; suspected gang members bought up every copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newsstands.


The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.


Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.


He'd survived for so long, his friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.


He was a veteran reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling $50 shares.


In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching the narco issue," said Bojorquez.


Over time the paper earned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.


Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody else dared to cover.


Eight years after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for coverage in Latin America.


That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug story wherever it led.


He freely acknowledged that he was frightened.


"I want to carry on living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.


Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV.


"You have to assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play dumb.


I don't want to be asked, 'What were you doing in the face of so much death ... why didn't you say what was going on?'"


The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.


They relied on his routine.


He would always wear his hat.


He would go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and would always sit at the same table.


Now, they ask: Was his love of routine his downfall?


His death also has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their jobs and stay alive.


"They don't like it if you mess with their women, their children, their clean businesses, their clandestine airstrips" used to move drugs.


"Those things were off-limits," said Bojorquez.


The result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.


Trusting one's instincts.


If it smells wrong, stay away.


The trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, is that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing with Javier happened."


The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.


The landscape constantly shifts.


In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed; days before, it was revealed that spyware sold exclusively to governments had been used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.


Outside, two police officers sought relief from the 104-degree (40 Celsius) heat in the shade of a tree.


They were assigned by the state government to guard Riodoce's offices, housed in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.


Half-jokingly, some of the reporters wondered whether these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself has said are not trustworthy.


It has been months since the reporters have gone into the mountainous countryside, where the drug gangs are in de facto control.


For this week's edition Riodoce was looking at three main stories.


There was the killing of former boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez's brother in Sinaloa.


They also had an expose on government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.


And there was a group kidnapping in one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.


There was no official word on who was abducted or how it happened, so caution set in when it came time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite of both drug traffickers and authorities.


A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party, or PRI, which dominated all levels of politics for nearly all of the last century.


Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption in high-profile cases.


Villarreal asked the reporter to write about prior incidents in that locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.


Just months before, readers would have looked to Valdez's column for the best-sourced information about the kidnapping.


"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender build.


"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been broken."


Valdez's office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as staff have become something they never expected to be: activists on behalf of the press.


Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office over yet another journalist.


Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.


A burned body has been discovered and officials say it is his, based on DNA tests.


Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.


On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.


At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.


She has since asked to be reassigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.


Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.


In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not just by drug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.


The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.


"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," Ramirez said.


Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.


No one forgets the death six years ago of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.


Her body was found along with a note purportedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."


A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.


Some outlets have opted to close, such as the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the killing of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.


Others keep going, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did following the killing of its director in 2004.


In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial titled, "What do you want from us?"


Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.


It's a wrenching decision.


It's hard to find work in exile, and they still scan the streets, looking for danger.


And sometimes, they are hunted down, as apparently was photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in a Mexico City apartment three months after fleeing Veracruz.


For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance of high-risk decisions.


Ibarra - who once wanted to be a poet - admits that covering the drug trade scares him.


"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.


At midnight on a recent Friday, with the latest issue already put to bed, Riodoce editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer, when all at once, their phones began to buzz.


A series of shootouts involving gang rivals and security forces near the beach resort city of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.


The war continued to escalate, as was promised by a series of cartel messages discovered in the area.


From the curb, via cellphone, they put the news up on Riodoce's website.


The front page would have to be changed the next day.


Sirens wailed nearby - another shootout in the area.


Bojorquez glanced over at the police officers standing guard to see if they were alert.


If they were at all afraid, they didn't show it.


Beneath the massive portrait of their newspaper's fallen founder, his middle finger displayed for all of Sinaloa to see, the staff of Riodoce was following in his footsteps.


"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when the same day Javier was killed the intern asked me to send her out to report on the street?"


Size of China’s self drive tourism market may exceed RMB1 trillion by 2020


[Abstract] Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers.


At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges.


Against the general backdrop of consumption upgrading and widespread popularity of free-and-easy travel, self drive tourism has received support from national policies, and is welcomed by an increasing number of consumers.


At the same time however, the self drive travel market, the size of which is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion, is confronted with twin challenges. On the one hand, the development of the self drive travel industry is out of step with market demand. Self drive travel organizers such as self drive clubs and travel agents are confronted with meager profits. On the other hand, self drive travel ae confronted with infrastructure and services that are still in their infant stages.


Accounting for 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism, with market size expected to exceed RMB1 trillion


In 2016, domestic tourism numbered some 4.44 billion persons, with self drive travel accounting for approximately 60% of total tourists in domestic tourism. By 2020, the size of the self drive travel market is expected to exceed RMB1 trillion.


Statistics concerning the number of persons engaged in self drive travel published by China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association showed that the number of persons engaged in self drive travel has continued to grow over the last five years. The share of such tourists as a proportion to domestic tourists has stabilized at above 50%.


At the same time, all regions as well as the State have shown greater concern and support for self drive tourism, this new emerging sector. From 2016 to 2017, a slew of policies and regulations relevant to vehicles for self drive travel, and motorhome and camping tourism have been promulgated.


In July 2017, eight government agencies including the China National Tourism Administration and the State General Administration of Sports jointly issued the “Plans for the Development of Automobile Campsites for Self Drive Sports”. In the same month, in the “Action Plan for Advancing Quality Enhancement and Upgrading in Rural Travel Development (2017)“ jointly printed and circulated by 14 government agencies including the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Finance, self drive travel was mentioned as a priority.


The introduction of policy measures has provided opportunities and policy guidance for the development of domestic self drive travel.


Self drive travel clubs make meager profits; complete industry chain is key


Although there is enormous potential in the self drive travel market, and active guidance from national policy measures, the self drive travel industry is still at its infancy stage.


According to the “2016-2017 Annual Report on the Development of China’s Self Drive Travel Industry”, domestic self drive travel clubs, automobile clubs and automobile enthusiasts clubs number in the thousands, tourists who arrange their own travel itinerary account for a larger proportion. The proportion of tourists who join automobile enthusiasts clubs, self drive travel clubs and other such entities only account for about 15%.


Meanwhile, there are only a handful of online tour companies and traditional travel agencies that develop proprietary products for self drive travel. Many online travel platforms only sell self drive travel products provided by some suppliers. Some self drive travel clubs are also key suppliers.


In terms of organizing self drive travel activities, this encompass various aspects including “board, lodging, transport, travel, shopping, entertainment”. Fragmentation is high, and upstream supply chain heavy. There is also significant randomness in tourist spending.


Li Guanjie, founder and CEO of Beijing XTX Auto Club, believes that self drive travel clubs are similar to travel agencies in essence. The primary earnings model at the initial stage are mainly based on offline activities. The core areas are self drive travel route products and guide services.


However, there is significant product homogeneity in route products within the self drive sector, and the standard of guide services is mixed. Self drive travel clubs are again confronted with the need to restructure.


It is quite apparent that self drive travel is not an independent industry in and of itself. Rather, it is an inter-regional and -industry ecosystem based on movement characteristics of self drive travel. The creation of a complete industry chain is key.


Experts have pointed out that in addition to basic tourist consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.


Hence, with regards to the development of the self drive travel industry, the experience feature should be enhanced. A “self drive travel +” theme as well as self drive travel product IP should be developed.


Scenic routes are not merely roads, and automobile campsites should not merely meet board and lodging requirements


Confronted with the rise in self drive travel, the development of self drive travel infrastructure is similarly still fairly rudimentary.


Li Guanjie pointed out that scenic travel routes are not merely a road. Rather, traffic and tourism elements should be integrated into it. However, building roads and tourism are the responsibility of two separate department. The increase in tourism element by transport departments are still stuck at the level of building rest rooms, information centers, publicity bulletin boards and other such facilities. Their degree of bonding with the tourism is low.


These could draw lessons from the building experience of the renowned self drive route of “US Route 66”,


The design of scenic routes is no longer the most direct and fastest route from the place of origin to the destination but adhering to the design concept of “experience the joy of driving” so as to provide self drive travelers the best enjoyment of beautiful scenery along the route. Scenic routes are able to connect spots and facets of the travel landscape. These would help retain the historical value and cultural value of the eco-tourism resources along the route. Meanwhile, various thematic activities may also be held to enhance tourist participation and recreation experience, creating economic benefit for the local tourism industry.


In addition to scenic routes, campsites are also important supporting facilities for self drive travel.


However, a Beijing News reporter understands from self drive travelers that few consumers would choose to stay at campsites.


They believe that many campsites are infrastructure and can only meet board and lodging requirements. Considered low class with dull product features, they are unable to meet the multi-faceted demands of self drive travel.


An industry insider who wished to remain anonymous said that a few years ago, enterprises operate campsite mostly for the purpose of acquiring land. After they acquire the land, follow-up development of complementary infrastructure and services have not caught up. These operators are loss-making, and do not have later-stage capital injection. Hence, providing corresponding complementary products proved very difficult.


Consumer groups


Data published by the China Tourism Automobile And Cruise Association in 2017 showed that in terms of age, self drive travelers are concentrated in the 21-40 age group, mostly in the 31-40 cohort. This group has a certain level of income, and are relatively demanding in terms of customized travel. Many are family oriented customers.


A survey in lodging revealed that self drive travelers prefer non-standard lodging.


In terms of self drive travel categories, driving in neighboring areas is the predominant category, accounting for 84. 32%.


Self drive travel overseas is a dream for many, but the proportion is still relatively small.


Meanwhile, with higher consumption demand, tourists who enjoyed self drive “tour of sights” have begun to change their opinion. Instead of “alighting to take photos, and boarding to sleep” during the self drive travel process, they are now more concerned with the travel experience and process.


Dinosaur used camouflage to evade its enemies


At first glance, it looks like a statue albeit a terrifying one.


Now researchers have revealed the first findings from the incredible rhino-sized creature found by a Canadian miner were so well preserved experts have described it as 'the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs'.


It was so well preserved, they were even able to determine the colour of its scaly skin was a reddish brown - and say it had something of a 'troubled past'.


The report in the journal Current Biology described it as 'the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.'


The fossil is a newfound species of nodosaur, which lived midway through the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.


It's incredible well preserved state has stunned researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'


The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reports in National Geographic.


It was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.


He hit something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.


The fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.


They spent the next six years working on uncovering the beast within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) lump of earth.


After all that hard work, the finished result is now ready to be unveiled.


'If you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping,' said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.


'It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs.'


By studying its skin, researchers found that this plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.


The heavily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern-day animals.


This would have allowed it to better blend into its surroundings and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.


The 110-million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaur family, first hit headlines in May and is now on view at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.


Researchers have now studied and named the beast Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering it.


The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armour across its body.


They discovered countershading, a common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.


Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size far exceeds that of countershaded animals alive today.


It suggests the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favoured concealment over confrontation as a means of survival.


But most contemporary animals that have countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling that this nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.


'Strong predation on a massive, heavily-armored dinosaur illustrates just how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.


Chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would have been reddish brown.


Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to find out what it ate for its last meal.


They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was swept out to sea, where it sank on its back to the ocean floor.


At that time, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread far further inland than they do now.


'This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in preserved scaly skin, yet is also preserved in three dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.


'The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did back in the Early Cretaceous.


You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it; if you just squint your eyes a bit, you could almost believe it was sleeping.'


The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.


Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.


They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.


The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopelta was washed out to sea after it died and mummified in mud.


The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.


According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.


The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).


It featured two 20-inch-long spikes which protruded from its shoulders.


The researchers believe that the this armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river swept it into open sea.


But the dinosaur's undersea burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.


The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cover bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's skull.


As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.


The more I look at it, the more mind-boggling it becomes.


Fossilized remnants of skin still cover the bumpy armor plates dotting the animal's skull.


Its right forefoot lies by its side, its five digits splayed upward.


I can count the scales on its sole.'


Reporters understand that adding alginate, humic acid and amino acid nutrient carriers of natural or plant sources into the production process of urea would change modify and enhance the benefit of traditional urea. The alginate urea, zinc fulvate urea and aminoglutanic acid urea nitrogen utilization rate was 5 to 10 percentage points higher than general urea.


In a positive environment, an increase in crop yield potential will be significant; in particular, large value-added urea pallets are quality raw materials for bulk blending fertilizer.


The total number of security personnel is double that of the 2012 London Olympics.


In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil will start the largest ever security linkage plan.


Earlier, Brazil government has said that a total of 85,000 troops and polices, including 20,000 troops and 65,000 polices, will fight together for the security of the Olympics.


Most troops will be responsible for safeguarding the Olympic venues, while the new 3,000 troops will be responsible for the security of international airports, subway stations and streets.


The polices will patrol around other areas of the city, including subways, buses and streets.


It is reported that 6,000 soldiers have arrived in Rio and provided security services for the Olympics.


In addition to the four competition areas, they will also patrol airports and main roads connecting airports to the Olympic venues.


Appraisal mechanisms in the services sector are nothing new. The key to having these appraisal mechanisms play an effective role is to have more effective supervision, rather than being a mere formality.


How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'


On Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.


Just a day after arriving in New York City on a trip, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on her phone.


She stumbled upon a post from someone from high school.


"The police just killed an 18 year old kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.


Confused, noticing no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.


A user with the handle @TheePharoah was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.


The St. Louis-area rapper was live-tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.


He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for four hours.


"This is wild," Ferrell thought to herself.


But death was nothing new for her and her community.


She put down her phone only to return later that evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.


There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father holding a sign that read, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"


She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.


In another video, a different cop, she said, cocked his rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you ... animals."


"'This is not usual,'" Ferrell recalled saying.


"'This isn't the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical.'


In that moment I felt chills.


I was angry and crying."


She booked a return flight and went home the next day.


After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her dad's house and decided the two of them would head to Ferguson the next morning.


What happened, to Ferrell and to Ferguson in the following almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in theaters Aug. 11.


It's a tale of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.


As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless times before that morning "about the black experience and black condition."


"You remember how I taught you about when black people had to fight for what they believed in?" she recalled saying.


"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.


I couldn't not take her," Ferrell said later.


"This happening today is a culmination of ... that has happened in the past.


She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.


She needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must do to get free, to free ourselves.


Even if I'm fortunate enough to provide her an experience where she doesn't personally experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.


I feel like I would be doing her a disservice to shield her from that."


The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of sorts as the activists awaited word of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.


There Ferrell and her daughter linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.


They prepared bags and helped pass them out to protesters.


Slowly, a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.


"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an undergrad at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Assn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.


"I had no experience in organizing.


It all just came."


Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.


Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to document" what was happening.


A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"


That skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - often white - coming into a community to profit off its pain and resilience.


As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We had heard that people who are born and raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we wanted to do it differently."


Folayan had already linked up with co-director Damon Davis, an area artist known for his activism around death row inmates.


His involvement endeared Ferrell to the project, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" team followed in the years after Brown's shooting.


"This documentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's us speaking," Davis said.


"That was the main thing for me, how these people will be represented, because that's how I will be represented."


While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an effort to show that the movement is "not about a messiah leader but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open of the film's participants.


As a result, "Whose Streets?" documents surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, like falling in love and marrying her wife.


"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.


"But I understood that with doing this work and humanizing black folks, there has to be a level of vulnerability."


Moreover, Ferrell's story reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.


Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black teen Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.


"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferrell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.


Black queer women have to bear the brunt of it all."


Folayan agreed noting that "the movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women."


She insists, however, that "this is not some affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identities.


"She was the person who was galvanizing this energy," she said.


"It's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life at those intersections as a black queer woman, you have so much on the line.


You can feel her energy through the screen."


Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone but fraught racial ties between the community and police persist.


Ferrell is on probation for 2½ more years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.


She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls home simply: "A mess."


Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson's streets a full three years ago.


"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.


It is our duty to win.


We must love and support each other.


We have nothing to lose but our chains."


Online translation services were actually already available on the Internet a decade ago, and in fact, a very long time ago, there was a prevalent view that “machines will replace human translation”.


A Becoming Resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA


In the center of the room at New York's Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, each bearing an almost imperceptible resemblance to one another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.


The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.


Manning sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leaking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.


The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.


It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama when he had just three days left in office.


By algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portraits of what someone with that genomic data might look like, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on not only the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also identity.


Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman as early as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.


From prison, her image was repressed, so much so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver's seat wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she became associated.


In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming off the massive success of her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.


In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure an image of what these folks might look like.


That was when she received an email from Paper Magazine.


"They were conducting an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted some kind of portrait to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.


And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed at that time, so they reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA portrait made.


The artist and her incarcerated muse became unlikely pen pals, exchanging several letters over the course of two years.


They even created a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the president would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd be able to see the exhibition in person.


That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release just days after the book went public was a welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years at a military prison in Kansas.


There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government leakers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions he's been called on to mend.


When asked about the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."


In an artist statement written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."


On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.


By including the 200 letters (or nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustrate how astoundingly similar, at least in biological makeup, we all are.


"What I'm hoping that people will take away from this is that our genome doesn't care about who we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.


"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so this is 30 of those stories."


The final piece in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is one page from the aforementioned graphic novella.


It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with a speakerphone in hand.


"When they chill your speech, then they've won," it reads.


"So never shut up."


"It came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.


"I get goosebumps still talking about it."


Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but when she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, her own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.


That was purposeful, too, as is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) at which her genetic haplogroups were written in pencil.


"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.


"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind freeing her as well."


Northwestern Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Homicide


A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was found fatally stabbed inside a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.


On Monday, first-degree murder warrants without bail were issued for Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, Cook County court records show.


The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after being stabbed multiple times.


A community alert released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.


Officers received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several lacerations on his body.


Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the scene and detectives are investigating the stabbing as a homicide while police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.


Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.


Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations, said in an emailed statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.


"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in that investigation," Cubbage said.


Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.


A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that, "We have been in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigating authorities in any way they need."


The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.


Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly encourages the suspects to surrender to authorities.


"Police have an idea of their whereabouts but our efforts to locate that are intensifying," Guglielmi said.


Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping find the suspects.


Guglielmi said police received a call from the Grand Plaza building manager who had just received a cryptic tip that said something had occurred in apartment 1008.


Police described the scene as very gruesome.


Guglielmi said it is unclear if the incident also occurred on July 27.


Lathem and Warren were confirmed to be at the building by security cameras, he said.


"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.


The management team at Grand Plaza released a statement to residents saying, "Police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."


"We'll complete WADA roadmap in near future" - Russian Deputy PM Mutko


Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the reinstatement of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).


"A certain stage of fulfilling the road map criteria has been carried out, RUSADA obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).


The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard," Mutko stated on Thursday.


The PM was commenting on the second part of WADA's Roadmap to Code Compliance, which describes the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and which recently published on the organization's website.


According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia.


"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.


And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee [IOC] and WADA in the near future," he added.


One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, states that Russian anti-doping authorities must publically accept the reported outcomes of the WADA-sanctioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.


Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation, as our anti-doping system admitted a failure.


All measures have been implemented.


But there were no state programs, and we will not admit something that didn't exist."


Mutko's words echoed those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.


Talking to Russian outlet RSport earlier in the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping bodies, but added: "We have said on numerous occasions, that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.


No one plans to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.


RUSADA was suspended from carrying out doping controls within Russia by WADA in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.


It was, however, permitted to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) this June.


Following a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is "moving in the right direction" to be reinstated.


As far as computers are concerned, whether Chinese checkers or chess, defeating humans was already a clinch decades ago.


The president of Croatian Football Association Davao Suk said in an interview that participation in the China Cup is very meaningful for Croatian football, and the Chinese Cup’s bonus was considerable.


Forget purchasing agents! These 8000-plus products enjoy zero tariff


At the regular press conference of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) held on January 11th, spokesperson Gao Feng said that to date, China has 15 Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) in force, involving 23 countries and regions, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff.


Meanwhile, you no longer have to spend a lot of money to have purchasing agents buy the products you want such as imported cosmetics, salmon from Iceland, red wine from Chile, tropical fruits from ASEAN ....


Currently, China has signed 16 FTAs, involving 24 countries and regions, of which 15 have come into effect, encompassing more than 8000 imported products at zero tariff.


Take agricultural produce for example. The implementation of the FTAs has meant that consumers can now sample affordable agricultural produce from different places of production throughout the year.


For instance, import tariffs have been cut to zero for the following products: tropical fruits from ASEAN such as durians, lychees, and pitaya from 15-30% previously;


salmon from Iceland, from 10- 12%; and


red wine from Georgia and Chile, from 14-30%.


Specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder from New Zealand have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.


Industrial products have benefited as well. For example, import tariffs for some cosmetics from Switzerland have been reduced to zero, while


that for some watches have fallen to 50%, and will fall further to zero in a few years’ time;


products from South Korea such as refrigerators, rice cookers, massage devices, and cosmetic apparatus will now be subject to a lower import tariff of 40%, and fall further to zero in a few years’ time;


and consumer electronics and other relevant products have also seen a relatively large reduction in tariffs.


Products at zero tariff under the FTAs also include intermediates and raw materials required for the domestic production of end-user consumer goods, which will, to a certain extent, also upgrade the mix of domestically produced consumer goods.


MOFCOM spokesperson Gao Feng said that approximately one-third of China’s total imported products enjoy tariff concessions under the FTAs, of which the majority are end-user consumer goods, thus providing tangible benefits to consumers.


Further reductions in import tariffs of consumer goods


On December 1, 2017, China further lowered the import tariffs of some consumer goods. The reductions covered 187 eight-digit HS codes comprising food, health supplements, pharmaceuticals, chemical products for daily use, clothing, footwear and headgear, home appliances, culture and recreation, miscellaneous and sundry goods, as well as other consumer goods.


The average tariff rate of these consumer goods more than halved, plunging from 17.3% to 7.7%!


With effect from January 1, 2018, partial adjustments were also made to other import and export tariffs.


The import tariffs of lipstick, eye shadow, perfume and some other cosmetics fell from 10% to 5%.


This decline in tariff rates means that consumers do not have to have a purchasing agent or travel overseas to buy the foreign products they like.

Foreign press: Year-end return policies at US malls vary widely; be cautious when returning gifts


China News Service, December 29


US-based “World Journal” reported that there was a wave of gift returns just after Christmas.


A report by American Broadcasting Company (ABC) revealed that approximately half of the goods sold last Christmas were exchanged or returned.


Elsewhere, readers had repeatedly reported having been cheated while shopping online. Shoppers should be on their guard when shopping at unofficial websites.


In general, large shopping companies have official and reasonable return procedures, but if you have shopped for gifts at certain small stores or online, you must be careful.


A Madame Hou of Rowland Heights bought a jacket from an online store specializing in print jackets for more than $60 (USD, the same hereinafter) on December 1, local time, but has yet to receive her purchase.


She sent an email to customer service but did not receive any reply from the store.


Elsewhere, a netizen revealed that when on tour in the US last year, he bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, but received a box of plasticine on delivery instead.


After he realized he was deceived, he applied for a refund from the website. Fortunately, he was able to receive a full refund.


Nonetheless, some customers felt that website refund services are not perfect.


Mr Wang, an ethnic Chinese resident of Northern California, purchased goods at a certain website on urgent delivery services twice at a cost of $4 each but both times, the goods failed to arrive promptly.


He applied for a refund subsequently but did not get a reply.


Large department stores or shopping malls have better return policies.


Most of Macy’s merchandise may be returned for a full refund within 180 days,


but the merchandise has to be in its “original” state, and the customer has to produce proof of purchase such as the receipt or the bank purchase record.


Without proof of purchase, the customer may also receive the store’s credit which may be used to purchase other merchandise.


Target has a 90-day return deadline for general merchandise. For electronic products, the deadline is normally 15 days,


but it is extended to 30 days for electronic and entertainment related products purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017;


note that the 30-day return deadline begins on December 25, i.e., merchandise purchased must be returned by January 25, 2018.


The ultimate shopping experience with the advent of a new era in commercial district shopping development


More than 10 years ago, China was, on the whole, still a sellers’ market. Selection was limited, and so was demand.


A decade hence, the market has long developed into a buyers’ rather than that of a sellers’ market. Shoppers have now become a lot more demanding as well, and are no longer satisfied simply with a “cash on delivery of goods” shopping behavior.


Therefore, how to offer shoppers the ultimate shopping experience has become the next competitive point for real estate developers.


Of the many factors that affect a shopper’s shopping experience, the impact of shopping centers in business districts is the most important.


Let’s take a look at how urban builders focus on the shopping experience.


No two leaves are alike, nor can one find two completely identical shopping malls. A famous shopping mall must have its own characteristics.


Take Turkey’s world-renowned Kanyon Shopping Center. Its unique undulating architectural design was inspired by the Grand Canyon, hence its homophonous name Kanyon. You feel like you’re in the Grand Canyon when walking along the 200-meter footpath in the midsection of Kanyon.


In addition to the canyon-like design, there is a large unique inward concave oval-shaped performance venue in the middle of shopping center where specialty performances are often held.


Its open platform design offers visitors at every floor a view of the activities held in the “canyon”, and the scene changes as you take each step.


In China, the Nanjing Forest Mall Commercial Street, known as the country’s first forest style pedestrian consumption venue, is a perfect integration of shopping and ecology as well as fairy tales.


With a 7,000 sqm green plaza, and a 3,000 sqm rooftop water feature, the project is made up of nine individual buildings, linked by a sky bridge. The sunken garden design for the entire project, plane trees as its architectural surface, and the rooftop water feature create the feeling of being in a forest.


On entering the Forest Mall, you’d feel like you have accidentally fallen down the rabbit hole in Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland. The tall tree trunks surround the buildings, and the lawn and stream are beautifully juxtaposed, drawing the masses into a forest full of life and vitality.


Then there is Chonqing. The Lijia Waterfront Business District built by Longhu Properties has plans to attract a diverse range of businesses, and expects to bring in more than 50 world class flagship stores, with more than 100 world class brands and over 500 renowned foreign and domestic brands so as to create a commercial center with a distinctive theme that brings the services sector together.


In addition, the Lijia Waterfront Business District will also integrate ecology into architecture. Based on a transit-oriented development (TOD) concept, it integrates shopping, household services and amenities, dining, entertainment, education and sports, providing shoppers the ultimate shopping experience while affording them the luxury of enjoying Chongqing’s unique “waterfront culture”, a perfect blend of shopping, and water entertainment and recreation.


From the above examples, it is noted that, at present, a number of real estate developers have noticed the discovery of this new urban business phenomenon. Insiders indicate that this consumption model which is centered on the consumer experience and which explores the means to combine shopping and experience will become the mainstream of urban development in the future.


Today’s business districts are no longer merely the distribution centers of goods. Rather, they are more integrated venues that bring together the arts and culture as well as creative themes; they also carry the responsibility of the masses toward urban living.


Therefore, in addition to meeting the one-stop material needs of dining and entertainment of consumers, maximizing the transmission of multi-tiered cultural and artistic spiritual needs, as well as bringing the livable qualities of residential needs into play will inevitably become the high point of future business district development.


In Chongqing, Guoxing Property’s Beianjiangshan is located north of the Yangtze River, close to Guanyin Bridge, where the who’s who of world business and international giants agglomerate, and first class brands congregate, affording a seamless connection with international fashion.


Here, prosperity abounds, and the best in the world agglomerate.


Dongyuanjinyue, which is in the immediate vicinity of Nanping Business District, has a better shopping environment. At its sole disposal is Western China’s, and indeed, the nation’s leading four-story three-dimensional transportation system, enhancing shopping comfort.


Elsewhere, the landscaped gardens and shops along the two pedestrian streets at Huigong Road and Wanda Plaza have been upgraded, with approximately 300 trees planted, and 40,000 sqm of floor space revamped, lifting the image of Nanping Business District.


Meanwhile, Longhu’s Waterfront City, in the immediate vicinity of Chongqing’s first low-density waterfront business district - Lijia Waterfront Business District - is surrounded by nine parks. The commercial street district is low density with good access. These qualities have made shoppers more willing to stay, stop and slowing savor the joy of shopping when shopping, rather than being jostled by crowds of shoppers into rushing forward. Here, “shopping at a leisurely pace” is truly achieved.


Competition will only intensify going forward. In a market of rampant homogenization, how to achieve success, and attain a reputation as a “shopping mecca” in the hearts of future shoppers deserve serious consideration among all real estate developers.


A differentiation strategy alone is far from sufficient. Only developers that truly place shoppers in their hearts, empathize with shoppers, and offer shoppers an ultimate yet simple shopping experience will be able to stand tall in a market when assailed by intense competition.


To be sure, I believe that, at the end of the day, Chongqing’s residents are the happiest lot to have such excellent shopping experience and business districts. A decade ago, no one would have imagined today’s prosperity.


Shopping carnival: Consumerism revelry masks true environmental cost


RMB168.2 billion. That was the amount of money Tmall users spent over a 24-hour period on November 11, 2017 at the “Tmall 11.11 Global Shopping Festival”.


Specifically, in the span of three minutes right after the “Double 11” commenced, Tmall’s transaction volume surpassed RMB10 billion, and exceeded RMB20 billion in six minutes and five seconds; within nine hours, it broke through the RMB100 billion mark.


That day, shoppers all over the world made a total of 1.48 billion payments by way of Alipay, an increase of 41% year-on-year.


Such spending resulted in 812 million logistics orders.


Whether the Tmall shopping platform or the Alipay payment platform, however, both belonged to Jack Ma’s Alibaba Group.


Ten years ago, no one would have imagined that the “Singles’ Day” subculture which was a self-deprecating celebration created by singles on November 11 would be co-opted by e-commerce merchants, and turned into a phenomenal “Singles’ Day” shopping carnival today.


Alibaba used the “Great Singles’ Day Sale” marketing gimmick: Not dating? Singles, come shop online - for the first time on November 11, 2009.


The outcome was a surprise. That day, transactions at Taobao Mall (the predecessor of “Tmall”) surpassed RMB52 million, 10 times that of the normal daily transaction value at the time.


From then on, “Double 11” has become a shopping festival created by Alibaba, and has grown and expanded from a domestic buyer-seller amusement to an inflow of global merchants. Nine years hence, and the more than RMB100 billion worth of transactions of Tmall’s “Double 11” is now more than 3200 times that of the first year, far outstripping that of “Black Friday”.


Numerous e-commerce merchants have followed Tmall’s “Double 11” sales promotion, with “JD.com” the strongest competitor.


“JD.com” has its own shopping festival “6.18” but its impact is less than that of “Double 11”. From November 1 to 11 this year, “JD.com”’s accumulated sales amounted to RMB127.1 billion.


The “Double 12” discount extravaganza and the Christmas-New Year shopping period come right after “Double 11”.


Following the New Year, pre-Spring Festival’s Lunar New Year shopping as well as Valentine's Day shopping await the Chinese consumer. Retail consumption knows no holiday.


Massive instantaneous consumption has led to environmental problems, which has attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.


A Xinhua Daily Telegraph report revealed that based on the industry’s general standard conservative estimate of 0.2 kg per packaging cartons, at least 300,000 tonnes of trash were generated during this year’s “Singles’ Day” period.


Liu Hua, Director of the Pollution Prevention Program at Greenpeace East Asia told chinadialogue that the volume of orders at this year’s “Singles’ Day” from Tmall alone would generate 160,000 tonnes of packaging trash.


In 2016, the State Post Bureau published a report stating that approximately 780 million items were delivered by express couriers during the 2015 “Singles’ Day” period (November 11-16), with more than 3 billion woven bags, 9.922 billion packaging cartons, and 16.985 billion meters of adhesive tape used. The length of adhesive tape used could go round the equator 425 times.


This year, the State Post Bureau estimates that the “Singles’ Day” express business volume could surpass 1.5 billion items.


Wang Shi, manager of a waste incineration plant in Beijing told Xinhua News Agency that more than 2,000 tonnes of trash enter the plant each day after “Singles’ Day”, exceeding the treatment capacity of the incineration plant.


Express delivery companies have also become aware that the environmental pollution resulting from the express delivery sector should not be ignored.


Some e-commerce logistics enterprises, including Suning, have introduced plastic express delivery boxes that may be recycled and reused ahead of “Singles’ Day”, as well as recyclable packaging such as shopping bags and trash bags that may be used repeatedly. However, acceptance among consumers who could not be bothered was low.


Jack Ma, on Weibo, has also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics”.


This Weibo received more than 68,000 “likes”.


What sort of mobile payment do Germans want?


Zhang Dongfang: The mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.


All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - the Chinese; is this really globalization?


Where there’s Alipay, there’s WeChat Pay.


According to the agreement with Germany’s electronic payment services provider Wirecard, WeChat Pay officially entered Germany in November this year. The Chinese company has also gradually expanded its presence among merchants in Europe.


This time round, the reunion of the two “fellow countrymen” in a foreign country took place in Europe.


All along, Alipay and WeChat Pay have been riding high on the road to globalization.


In a study on China’s mobile Internet payment’s globalization methods, iResearch Consulting’s “2017 China's Third-Party Mobile Payment Report” arrived at two methods: The first method would be by way of strategic investment, outward transfer of experience, taking an equity stake, and supporting the overseas local mobile payment enterprise;


the second method would be by way of promoting mobile payment services to overseas merchants through Chinese tourists’ overseas spending behavior, thereby changing overseas local entities’ recognition and acceptance of China’s mobile payments.


Indeed, win over the Chinese, and you win the world.


China’s rapid economic growth coupled with its large population base have meant that spending by Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure,


but this also means that the mobile payment war waged in Germany is nothing new.


All WeChat Pay and Alipay did was to move the battleground to Europe. Neither the competitors nor the battleground has changed - it’s still the Chinese; is this really globalization?


A more groundbreaking inquiry would be whether China’s mobile payment can expand its territory in Europe.


Germany is an example.


Magical “new retail”


Chen Xinlei, Yang Kaihan: When Amazon made it to the world’s top 10 list of retailers, it announced that it would venture into the bookstores and grocery stores; this is worth pondering, both in terms of opportunity and motive.


In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle. This was followed by two bookstores in Portland and San Diego.


At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened its bookstore and New York, and planned to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.


Almost at the same time, Amazon announced that its checkout-free grocery store Amazon Go would begin trial operations. No waiting in line or checkout is necessary. All customers have to do is scan their QR code on the Amazon Go app to enter the store, take the products they want and leave. The shopping amount would be charged to the customers’ Amazon account.


As far as Amazon is concerned, its sudden but frequent forays into physical stores in the last few years have been very unexpected.
