28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead at San Francisco Mall


A 28-year-old chef who had recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.


But the victim's brother says he can't think of anyone who would want to hurt him, saying, "Things were finally going well for him."


The body found at the Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.


The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is ongoing.


The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, previously a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as line chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.


A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.


"We are a small team that operates like a close knit family and he will be dearly missed," the spokesperson said.


Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends at this difficult time.


Louis Galicia said Frank initially stayed in hostels, but recently, "Things were finally going well for him."


"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.


Louis Galicia said he could not think of anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.


He was a kind spirit with a big heart.


His way of connecting with the family was always making us a dish, making us dinner," Louis Galicia said.


He never wanted to be in any kind of altercation.


He was the brother that went with the flow.


"With everything else that's going wrong with the world, he was that diamond in the rough that was shining bright every day," he said.

Junior doctors strike: Calls for fresh industrial action


Representatives of junior doctors have called on their union to authorise fresh industrial action in their dispute about a new contract.


The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is to ask its full council to back more industrial action from early September.


The JDC says ministers have failed to address concerns about the contract.


Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract deal agreed with the BMA.


It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the ballot.


In a letter to members released on Twitter on Thursday night, the JDC's chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "persistently silent" on issues which, she said, had resulted in the contract being rejected.


She said: "In light of this, the JDC Executive has voted to reject the proposed new contract in full and to call for formal re-negotiations on all of your concerns."


In response to the government's silence, JDC exec has today made a formal request for a special meeting of BMA Council to authorise a rolling programme of escalated industrial action beginning in early September.


The dispute has led to junior doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first all-out stoppages in the history of the NHS.


The BMA's junior doctor leader, Dr Johann Malawana, resigned following the vote to reject the negotiated terms of the contract, which the BMA had recommended.


He had told BMA members the deal was a good one that should be accepted, during meetings ahead of the poll of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.


Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be imposed on medics in England.


Russia and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?


It was a gesture that ended a crisis.


The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.


But, as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of a St. Petersburg palace, I got the distinct impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.


There was the handshake, yes.


But Mr Putin's smile looked thin and he was hardly oozing warmth even by his own restrained standards.


Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talked repeatedly of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.


I lost count.


He also pledged that relations with Russia would return not just to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.


The next day one newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.


To me, his enthusiasm implied the opposite.


But a lingering coolness emanating from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader has forgotten nothing.


In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.


Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.


Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.


The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.


Rebuilding real trust will be hard, perhaps impossible.


Russian public opinion has also turned since November.


For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, all-out offensive against Ankara.


All of a sudden, it seemed like Turks were to blame for everything.


Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family has profited from an illegal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.


He's denied that emphatically.


But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it's time to move on.


After all, this meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.


Russia could claim a victory of sorts.


For Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.


First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from power last month in a failed coup.


Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him too.


There is also an economic motive.


Russian sanctions have hit hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.


The number has slumped by almost 90%.


As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flights eventually resume.


They're banking on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.


And even this week, state TV has been predicting cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are permitted again.


"Tourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.


But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.


Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the attempted takeover.


Add to that its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks to join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitalise on the chill and chip away at Turkey's ties with the West.


The Russian leader certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.


Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.


So the summit at this glitzy, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.


Still, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.


The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back opposite sides.


It could be telling that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.


Turkey's president deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.


There is no clear consensus on where they can seek common ground on Syria.


But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.


Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside Scotland


The brand RBS is to be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.


Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.


Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the bank's global ambitions.


It has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out.


During that time, brand strategists have used 'RBS' to protect other consumer finance brands.


It was backed with millions of pounds in sponsorship of international sport, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.


But now, it has been judged right to let more national brands come to the fore.


Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be initialised.


In England and Wales, all RBS references, outside head office and the stock exchange listing, will be changed to NatWest.


The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.


There are other, smaller brands for private banking, which will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.


Mr McEwan was interviewed during a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.


He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will end up becoming our investor brand and the one that our staff are employed with, because we are now becoming much more a bank of brands."


As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became the global brand.


I'm now saying we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.


Each one of those brands will stand for something quite different in their own communities, and our staff will work with customers under those brands.


RBS had already stated that it would not to continue its Six Nations sponsorship, and it has been raising the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.


"The time is right for us to move to the bank of brands, because underneath (we've been asking) how do we focus on making this a better bank for customers?" said the chief executive.


It would have been very cynical three years ago if we'd said we're going to be a great bank for customers and put those brands out there.


But with the work we've been doing, focussing on the customers needs, not our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.


We can bring those brands back up again, so I think the time is right.


Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with victory at Newmarket on Predilection


Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket takes him to 3,000 wins


Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British winner at Newmarket on Friday.


He brought up the landmark with his second winner of the night at his local track - on Predilection, trained by John Gosden.


The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the landmark in Flat racing.


He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.


Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who earlier won on Ghayyar, said: "It's special."


I'm very emotional because my family are here as well


I'm very pleased for it to have happened at Newmarket because this is where I landed 30 years ago.


It's not a big meeting, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a mundane Friday night with 20,000 people.


I'm relieved and very humble.


Dettori soaks up the cheers as he brings in Predilection after victory


Two jockeys have reached the milestone in jump racing - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record-breaking career.


Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career wins


Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is no surprise he has reached this landmark so few have achieved before him.


He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical nous that sets him apart from others in the weighing room.


He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been drawing fans to the sport for years.


I said to Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom he'd have ridden 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big-race jockey!


Seriously though, Frankie's been riding winners in the UK for the best part of 30 years which is great to see.


He's a lively character which is good for British racing but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.


Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a trademark flying dismount


From flying finishes to flying dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the poster boy of British Flat racing for two decades.


It has been a rollercoaster ride.


Stacks of big-race winners, including his famous 1996 'Magnificent Seven' at Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and served a drugs ban.


Three years ago he initially struggled when returning from that six-month suspension, but he showed formidable strength of character to defy the doubters and return to his best.


And he may not be done for some time - Dettori has previously said he would like to carry on competing until the age of 50, at least.


Russia's Putin sacks chief of staff Sergei Ivanov


Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.


Mr Ivanov has been part of Mr Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.


The 63-year-old has now been made a special representative for environmental and transport issues.


A statement from the Kremlin said that Mr Putin had "decreed to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but gave no reason.


Mr Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.


Mr Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.


Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.


Later he managed presidential protocol and government staff, the Kremlin website says (in Russian).


On being appointed, he told Mr Putin: "Thank you for your trust."


I think the administration's most important task is to support your activity as head of state in terms of drafting laws and control over how your instructions are implemented.


Mr Putin told a Russian TV station on Friday that Mr Ivanov had asked to leave the post, and recommended that Mr Vaino should replace him.


Do the smiles convince?


This is a move that has mystified Moscow.


Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.


As chief of staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.


In a meeting with President Putin shown on state television both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.


But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before parliamentary elections.


So is this the fall-out from some kind of power struggle?


No-one knows yet.


But the official claim - that a man once touted as a potential president, suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy - has been met with great scepticism.


In remarks to Mr Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Mr Ivanov said "it's true that in early 2012 I asked you, in a conversation, to entrust me with this very complicated post, even - you could say - troublesome post, for four years.


Well, it turns out that I've been presidential chief of staff for four years and eight months.


Mr Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.


He served previously as a deputy prime minister and defence minister.


He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security service, like Mr Putin.


In the late 1990s, when Mr Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Mr Ivanov was appointed as his deputy.


When Mr Putin came to power, he named Mr Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.


It was once thought that Mr Ivanov might become president of Russia after Mr Putin's second term, as a third term for Mr Putin would have been unconstitutional.


But that post was taken by another close Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev.


Mr Putin became prime minister, before returning to the presidency just three-and-a-half years later.


Mystery as fish land in Banff garden


A Banff man has appealed for help in identifying fish that have appeared in his garden in Banff.


Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels deposited by a waterspout.


Mr Bain, who lives about 500m from the sea, posted footage of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.


Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife


The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017


Engineers have joined the Queensferry Crossing's north deck and viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.


It is the first of four closures between the "deck fans," which are now nearing completion around each of the bridge's three towers.


The bridge section from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.


It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete and 46 stay-cables.


The £1.35bn project is now due to be complete by May 2017.


Economy Secretary Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land on to the bridge.


He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of the Queensferry Crossing.


We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale on this project, with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used just to build this part of the bridge.


Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge completing the closure between the viaduct and bridge deck is a delicate operation involving extremely precise tolerances for fit up.


Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is now in place, the final section of deck is having its concrete deck cast in Rosyth today, meaning all the deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.


Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project director said: "The first closure on any bridge project is always a significant milestone.


On this fantastic project, this closure represents leading edge civil engineering.


After installing the last road deck section and connecting it to the expanding North Tower road deck, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north - or landward - side.


This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimetres southwards.


This was a massive and, at the same time, very delicate operation.


Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approximately 6,000 tonnes and had to be pulled up a gradient of about 3%.


Delicate because the tolerances the team were working to were tiny - just a few millimetres either way.


Happily, it all went very well.


Simone Biles nails all-around gold in women's gymnastics


Forget the pressure.


Forget the hype.


Simone Biles is immune to all of it.


Dynamic on vault.


Effortless on beam.


Jaw-dropping on floor.


Brilliant all over.


And now, finally, an Olympic champion.


The 19-year-old American gymnast soared to the all-around title on Thursday, putting the gap between herself and the rest of the world on full display under the Olympic spotlight.


Her total of 62.198 was well clear of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.


United States' Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.


Biles became the fourth straight American woman to win the all-around title and fifth overall while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.


She burst into tears when her final total was posted and her long journey to this moment ended.


The achievement puts her in the same league as once-in-a-generation athletes like Michael Phelps who have taken their sports to new heights:


Biles has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold - with routines so astonishing in their mix of ambition and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen."


One last test awaited in Brazil, a contest not so much between Biles and the rest of the field but between herself and the burden of oversized expectations.


Anything less than heading back to her family's home in Spring, Texas, with a fistful of golds would be seen as a disappointment.


United States' Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively for the artistic gymnastics women's individual all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.


Biles earned the first one on Tuesday while serving as the exclamation point to retiring national team coordinator Martha Karolyi's going away party.


While Biles insisted she's never looked ahead during her long run at the top, that's not exactly true.


A portion of her floor exercise routine - the one that includes her signature tumbling pass - is set to Latin music that would fit right at home in the street right outside the Rio Olympic Arena.


It's not a coincidence.


The girl adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a field trip to the gym where Boorman was coaching has become a force.


She hasn't lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that should go for as long as Biles wants it to.


Though Mustafina took a small lead through two rotations, it was a mirage.


Balance beam and floor exercise - where Biles is the defending world champion - lay in wait.


She went back in front with a 15.433 on beam - and capped it with a 15.933 on floor.


Raisman hugged her gently as they awaited the final score - a mere formality - and tears appeared around Biles' glittery red, white and blue eyeliner when the vision she once wrote in a scrapbook became a reality.


Raisman's performance was a bit of revenge from four years ago, when she tied for third but lost the bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreaker.


This time, the 22-year-old team captain the Americans call "grandma" was well ahead.


She blew kisses to the crowd after her floor exercise, overcome by a comeback that at times seemed in doubt.


As for Biles, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now carries a whole new meaning:


Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets," survives Philadelphia shooting


Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, marking the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.


The child's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.


The grandparents say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in his groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was awake when he was transported to the hospital.


"He just took a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.


I just can't believe it.


The boy is listed in critical condition at a hospital and has undergone several surgeries.


Family tells the station he is expected to recover.


He was set to start first grade at a local elementary school.


Brown was among four people shot in the Germantown section.


Also shot were three men: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year old.


One of the 29-year-old men was reported in critical condition; the other two victims were listed in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.


The child was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.


The other two victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.


Investigators tells CBS Philadelphia it appears there was crossfire between multiple gunmen.


Assault weapon-style shell casings, traced to different assault style weapons, littered the scene.


It appears that this was definitely an ongoing battle.


There were casings in the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.


So it appears that there were multiple armed combatants out here and that they were actively engaged," Philadelphia police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.


Multiple houses and vehicles in the area were also struck.


No arrests have been made and police are reportedly reviewing surveillance video.


Another 6-year-old, a girl, was hit in her arm by a stray bullet Tuesday while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.


She is recovering, and police are still searching for a suspect.


Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie


That's what I call this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team and for more reasons than one.


First, I have been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.


And second: This team features three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have been inspiring so many young girls of color.


The make-up of this team, rounded out by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, is making everyone proud.


This team looks, finally, like America.


It also has solidified the black and Latina female presence at the top of this sport.


For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been African-American.


Last year, Simone and Gabby were #1 and #2.


This is powerful.


Last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.


Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez delivering the unexpected, yet masterful gymnastics routines.


On Thursday, Simone became the fourth straight American to win gold in the women's individual all-around event.


And teammate Aly Raisman earned silver.


We are witnessing the top of the sport, but it does not look like this at gymnastics classes across the country.


Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make the Olympic team.


They are the "Final Five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is Marta Karolyi's last year coaching.


But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts primarily train in private gymnastics clubs that are maintained by parents paying the cost of the training, facility, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families) and the list goes on.


Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the business.


These clubs are where the gymnasts get all of their training, and it's a costly and long-term commitment for the gymnasts' families.


Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started in gymnastics.


We must bring more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to the communities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.


I founded my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.


At my organizations, we have provided free and low-cost gymnastics, based in Harlem, for over 15,000 urban youth (primarily black and Hispanic) and have trained national and international champions.


In September, we will be expanding to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high quality gymnastics to the youth that deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.


Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body and hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.


This combination provides life-long benefits for good health, success in school and work.


It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to take gymnastics and that is great.


To participate in sport is so important, especially for girls.


This is such an exciting time.


Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for that serious showcase of "Girl Power" in winning the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to begin their path to be healthy, strong and successful young women.


Junior doctors set to mount further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal


Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 junior doctors who took part in a ballot had rejected it.


In July, Mr Hunt revealed plans to impose the contract saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would be damaging for staff and patients.


The first junior doctors are moved onto the new contract, which includes changes to overnight and weekend working practices to improve care at unsociable hours.


Dr Ellen McCourt, the BMA's junior doctors" committee chair, said in a statement last night: "Junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, particularly that it will fuel the current workforce crisis, and that it fails to treat all doctors fairly."


With just eight weeks before the first group of doctors are moved onto the new contract, progress needs to be made and time is running out.


Efforts by the BMA to resolve the dispute through talks have been met with an unwillingness to engage and, at times, deafening silence from the government.


This is despite a promise from Jeremy Hunt just last month that his door is always open.


"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, lift the imposition and address junior doctors" concerns.


If he does not then junior doctors are clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.


The last strike at the end of April saw the postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nurses and consultants were drafted in to provide cover for doctors on the picket line.


Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to a reformed contract with British Medical Association officials.


The BMA wants better weekend pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who would be subject of the contract.


Daniel Mortimer, chief executive of NHS Employers, called on junior doctors not to go ahead with any strikes.


Mr Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves little or nothing, but places pressure on already stretched teams and services and causes worry, distress and disruption for patients, carers and their families."


Over the last two months we have been talking with the Junior Doctors Committee and have, along with the Department of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the Guardian Role and Whistleblowing.


Employers were hopeful that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as deployment, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from career breaks, costs of training, mutual recognition of syllabus, study leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in November, February and May.


The £2-a-day drug that can cut heart attack threat


Thousands of heart attack patients are to benefit from a £2-a-day drug, after officials recommended it be given to more people for longer.


Anti-clotting drug ticagrelor slashes the risk of repeat attacks for people with heart disease.


The drug is already given for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or another attack.


NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.


But now NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years, to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.


Some 140,000 people have a heart attack in England every year, and a quarter of these go on to have another attack or a stroke.


Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the build-up of fatty material in artery walls to form a plaque.


If the plaque breaks apart it can cause a blood clot, blocking blood to the heart causing a heart attack.


And if the clot dislodges it can travel in the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.


People who have already have one attack are at a higher risk of having another.


Ticagrelor, which is made by UK firm AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.


The draft NICE guidance, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60mg along with aspirin twice a day for another three years.


Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention treatments, as many as a quarter of people who have had a heart attack go on to have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences."


Fear of a recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.


The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective at reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.


In provisionally recommending ticagrelor we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who stand to benefit from it.


Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - particularly the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment with it beyond that period.


PC culture let vote fraud in Muslim areas flourish


Ex-Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting the government report


A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye being turned to widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, a devastating government report reveals today.


Ex-Cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles lambasts the police, election watchdogs and town halls for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse because of "over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."


The former communities secretary, now the anti-corruption tsar, said the intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so bad that police should be allowed to put cordons outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.


He recommends that voters should have to take ID to prove who they are when they vote.


Currently, a voter merely has to state their name and address.


The report even suggests putting indelible ink on a person's fingers as they cast their ballot to prevent anyone being able to vote twice.


Greater protection should be given to whistleblowers, Sir Eric says.


He calls for the Press to be given greater access to council papers and decisions taken by unofficial committees or working groups.


"This is not solely to protect against electoral fraud, but to protect local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it," he said.


The report was ordered by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets voting scandal in East London.


Last year a special election court ruled the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.


The court found Rahman "cynically perverted" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.


Rahman, it was said, "ran his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him."


Up to 300 votes were dubious or the result of personation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.


Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.


He voiced particular alarm about postal voting fraud - in which senior members of the Muslim community were said to have exerted pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choosing.


Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system including bringing your ID to prove who you are


His report says: "Evidence was presented of pressure being put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi background.


"There were concerns that... state institutions had turned a blind eye to such behaviour because of "politically correct" over-sensitivities about ethnicity and religion."


Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including banning political activists from handling postal ballot papers to stop "vote harvesting."


The report, being considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher checks on registration to prevent the electoral register being used for immigration and benefit fraud.


Consider the options for requiring voters to produce ID before voting.


Use indelible ink on a person's fingers once they cast their ballot to prevent anyone voting twice.


Carry out systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.


Put a three-year limit on requests for an automatic postal vote.


Ban political campaigners and activists from handling completed postal votes and postal vote envelopes.


Give police powers to set up cordons around polling stations.


Change the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.


Make it illegal to take pictures in polling stations.


Make it a requirement that only English is to be used in polling stations (except in Wales).


Strengthen training to ensure staff enforce the rule that voters go to the booth alone.


Sir Eric savages the Metropolitan Police, saying it is "astonishing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.


"The election court disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.


He was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - to a criminal standard of proof - on a series of grounds.


He also criticises the ineffectual "tick-box inspections" of town hall electoral registration departments.


Sir Eric said: "Last year's court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.


Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, yet the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.


Crazy for Kate's cyclist lookalike and other celeb doppelgangers of Rio Olympians


Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics this week have gone wild for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has proven an impressive lookalike for the Duchess of Cambridge.


But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only athlete out fighting for gold this summer that boasts their own celebrity doppelganger - at least not according to social media.


So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces crossing our screens at the moment, FEMAIL have compiled a list of Olympians who bear more than a passing resemblance with Hollywood celebs.


The hunter and the wolf: U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid


Aside from Kate's doppelganger on the cycling track, many people online have been quick to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of A-lister Leonardo DiCaprio.


U.S. Men's Archery Team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star surfaced.


And in fact, the archer became aware of the social media frenzy and admitted that he has been hearing that he looks like Leo since he was a kid.


'I personally don't see a huge resemblance, maybe besides the facial hair,' Brady told Huffington Post.


'He is a good-looking dude so I guess it's a compliment.'


One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 is undoubtedly going to be pointed out even more this year: the striking likeness between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.


Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be a dead ringer for Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.


And over in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been getting compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years now.


Changing it up: This user reckons that Nathan is an 'athletic version' of the Inception actor


Another long-running comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett who boast a similar heavy brow and lips.


Silver medal swimmer Russia's Yulia Efimova boasts more than just the same sunkissed skin and blonde hair as actress Annalynne McCord, while Team USA's Nathan Adrian has been said by fans to resemble an 'athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt.'


Tough women: Soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have similar face shapes and eyes


Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similaritiest


Floating a theory: According to this user, perhaps there is a reason behind the pair's similar looks


One Twitter user took to the site recently to declare her happiness that 'the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.'


Indeed, the USA soccer star and the Dexter actress share incredibly similar face shapes and eyes.


Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile that is near-identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautifully broad smile that matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.


CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'


Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place finish at the women's 4x200m freestyle relay outraged viewers of CBC's live Olympic coverage on Wednesday


Canadian broadcaster CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old female Chinese swimmer 'went out like stink' and 'died like a pig' during a race.


Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his mic was turned off when he started to dispense some of his own opinions at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.


MacDonald, who was brought on board CBC's commentary team to provide 'color' could be heard saying: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby'.


Too excited, went out like stink, died like a pig.


Thanks for that.


Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to close the gap on China.


Viewers across Canada were quick to react online after being shocked by the tone and the language used


Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'"????


The idiot didn't realize they were still on the air.'


Ai Yanhan of China in the Women's 4 x 200m Freestyle Relay Final was described as: 'That little 14-year-old from China dropped the ball, baby.'


Criticism on Twitter came thick and fast against Byron MacDonald with many calling him out


Twitter users did not hold back when the heard how insensitive Byron Macdonlad was being


Another twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.


You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.


Soon after, Scott Russel who was hosting CBC's broadcast apologized on-air for MacDonald's comment, saying: 'We apologize the comment on a swim performance made it to air.'


It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'


CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the remark


Fellow commentator, Scott Russel, had to make an apology on MacDonald's behalf


CBC then copied and pasted their apology to more than 90 other twitter users who complained about MacDonald's comments


The network was also quick to apologize and released a statement.


We sincerely regret that these statements were made, and that they were allowed to go to air.


We moved quickly last night to apologize to our viewers on-air and to our followers on Social media.


To be clear, Byron's comments were related to the swimmer's performance, not to her as an individual.


That said, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate choice of words and Byron is very sorry for what he said.


On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on-air and attempted to qualify his remark by stating he didn't mean for it to be construed as a personal attack.


'I would like to take a moment to apologize for a comment that I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.'


'I was referring to a swimmer's performance, and not to them as a person.'


'Needless to say, there was no disrespect intended and I'm very sorry.'


Primark shopper outraged at woman who brazenly tried on underwear in the middle of the shop


Shoppers didn't know where to look when a woman stripped off to try on knickers on the shop floor in the middle of a Primark.


To make it even worse, she sized up how she looked in them, peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.


She carried on browsing and eventually tried on four pairs of underwear at the store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone.


The Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping centre, Folkestone, where the woman tried on knickers before putting them back on the shelf


A mother-of-two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, said after trying on the underwear the mystery woman 'got dressed again and walked out of the store without buying anything.'


She said: 'People couldn't believe what they were seeing.'


Standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of knickers from the display, stripped off her own tights and pants and put them on.


'She didn't try to find anywhere discreet to do it - she just stood there, bold as brass.'


'Everyone was staring as she took the knickers off again and obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf.'


She did the same with three more pairs before finally deciding there was nothing she liked and she got dressed again and walked out.


'She didn't seem to care who was watching - or think about the person who would eventually buy the knickers she'd been trying on.'


Ms Davidson, 33, who lives in the Kent town, said: 'How disgusting to think someone is going to take home knickers that another person has been wearing and they haven't been cleaned.'


The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.


Ms Davidson added: 'I gather the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she had left - which is just as well.'


'I'd hate to get home with a new pair of knickers and find another woman had put them on and taken them off again, and they hadn't been washed.'


A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of an incident which took place in our Folkestone store on Tuesday August 9.'


All the product in question has been removed from sale.


How to defend yourself from gun attacks using Krav Maga


It's a dangerous world out there, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.


We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, New York-based grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with gun-toting muggers at close range.


Whether you're approached from in front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the tables on your mugger.


If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is turn around, so that you can see your attacker and 'clear the line of fire'.


You then grasp the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your free elbow.


A knee to the groin follows, and while the attacker doubles up in pain, you twist the gun from his hands, smack him in the face with the barrel and back up, keeping the weapon trained on him.


For gunmen approaching from the front, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it around so the villain can't fire.


At the same time, put weight on the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip before backing up and pointing it at him.


Sounds tricky?


Check the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.


But remember that the safest way out of any mugging - if you're not a Krav Maga grandmaster - is to hand over your cash.


Family of yobs destroyed Saltash, Cornwall council house ahead of eviction


A family of yobs left their council house with £50,000 worth of damage after they were evicted for terrorising their neighbours.


Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been kicked out of the property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.


After they were forcibly removed from the property, shocked housing associations officers found the property in a state of disrepair.


The walls were left with gaping holes, floorboards were ripped up, rubbish was strewn over the floor and graffiti was daubed on the walls.


The family have now been moved on and are believed to be living in a private accomodation


Donna McEvoy, housing manager at Cornwall Housing, said she feared it might be beyond saving.


She said: 'It's been an absolute nightmare for people down here and I don't think people should have to live like that.


There are a lot of things to weigh up because this property will probably be known by the not-so-nice element of Cornwall.


This family are notorious and their name is notorious.


The couple had three sons who lived at the property intermittently and police say the reign of terror the family inflicted included fighting in the street with baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing and excessive shouting, arguing and swearing.


Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the tenancy, was given an antisocial behaviour order in June.


Old rubbish was found in a number of the rooms of the house, which may be demolished


Floor boards had been pulled up in the property, from which drugs had been dealt in the past


Neighbours say they were seen fighting in the street and police were regularly called


Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcefully from the property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move on voluntarily.


The eviction was hailed by relieved neighbours who said their lives had been made a living hell.


One said: 'They didn't care about anybody.'


We lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been bad.


The amount of times we've seen the police down here is unbelievable.


'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'


We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!


It's going to be lovely now that they're finally gone.


Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's neighbourhood enforcement manager, said the family failed to cooperate with the local authority.


The family have lived in the house for 20 years, with police regularly called to the property


Rubbish and old toys have been thrown down the overgrown side of the council house


He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.


This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions must have been terrifying for her neighbours to witness.


I appreciate all the work that has been put in by my team, Devon and Cornwall Police and members of the community who bravely came forward to give us information.


I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbours and sends out a message that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.


Mr Fitzpatrick said that the three sons had all lived at the property at different times but said they were all in their 20s.


A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house after the eviction


Housing workers will now have to clear away the piles of rubbish which surround the house


In 2014, police raided the property and found more than 70g in cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.


Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply.


She claimed the money was going towards a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.


After being made homeless, it is understood that Tanya and her partner are now living in private housing in Plymouth.


The walls of many of the house's rooms had graffiti scrawled across them.


Police say they will seek to evict tenants who flout the rules of their tenancies


Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.


'This sends out to those who feel that they can behave without recrimination, as well as those blighted by such behaviour,' she said.


Criminal and antisocial behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.


Reid says Clinton will stick with Garland as Supreme Court nominee if elected


Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.


Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama nominated him in March.


Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person to replace late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.


Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he is predicting Clinton will pick Garland "with some degree of credibility."


A spokeswoman for Reid later said he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland and was speculating.


He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "rock the boat" with a new pick.


Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.


Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "minions" and "enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.


He said Trump is unfit for office.


Treats says nude calendar for 'women, as well as men'


Treats magazine is partnering with photographer David Bellemere to launch a 1970s' Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.


But instead of famous naked people, they're setting out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.


Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude-heavy magazine differs from old-school Playboys because "Playboy is for men."


I do this for women.


Apparently he thinks the calendar is, too.


"We need to get back to showcasing timeless and classic nudity where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body," Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.


Women will want to be a part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.


Models can submit pics online or in person at open casting calls in Los Angeles and New York.

French court rejects bid to demolish shops at Jungle refugee camp


A French court has rejected a bid by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp where thousands of refugees are living.


At a court hearing this week, Calais authorities had argued the state should be able to knock down a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or basic meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.


The Calais prefect's office argued the places should be demolished because they represented a parallel economy that did not pay tax, and because they carried fire and sanitation risks.


Humanitarian groups had told the court the shops and restaurants were vital, saying the free meals offered by a state-backed association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing numbers at the camp.


They argued the makeshift shops and restaurants often provided shelter and free meals to those in need.


A Lille court ruled there was no legal basis for expelling the people running the 72 makeshift shops, but said the Calais prefect's concerns "were totally understandable."


The judge, Jean-François Molla, said the groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people that "live in extremely precarious conditions."


He said the spaces provided calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.


One of the places that had been under threat from demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids" Cafe which is run not-for-profit and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for the hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.


More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the kids" cafe.


A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight."


Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday estimated that numbers in the Jungle camp have risen to over 9,000 people - the highest ever - after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer.


"This 5,000-yuan subsidy solved the problem of my pressing need for money."


Zhou Fen, a girl who was registered in the poverty-stricken file of Mipo Village, Changle Town, Huayuan County, received the letter of admission from University of South China.


When she was worried about the tuition, the county committee of the Communist Youth League offered she a 5000-yuan subsidy on August 9.


Recently, the related county government department has provided a subsidy totaled 2.838 million yuan to over 690 poverty-stricken college students.


It also organized social fund-raising for students who are extremely poor in financial status to help them accomplish their study.


This year, Huayuan County integrated more than RMB 18.5 million of educational funds and self-raised more than RMB 2.5 million, which will be injected into the real-name bank accounts of the corresponding students.


"I thought my elder brother and I cannot afford the college study after my father passed away. It never occurred to me before the county government helped us so timely." She said gratefully.


As of August 8, Huayuan County had raised more than 21 million yuan of various relief funds this first half year for 13,140 poverty-stricken students.


All poverty-stricken students of the county that should be supported have been supported financially.


According to the reporter on the scene, a large container truck shifted to the fast lane with the command of a traffic policeman. Its container box fell down onto the green road, making a 2 cm deep pit on the road.


According to the Xinhua news agency, Australia's New South Wales government announced on the 11th day of the month that it will spend 200 million Australian dollars (about 154 million US dollars) to launch the biggest renovation on the famous Sydney Opera House since its establishment.


The New South Wales government said the renovation would not change the shell shape of the opera house.


The Sydney Opera House is one of Sydney's landmark buildings, designed by Danish architect Jorn Utzon and built in 1973. It welcomes about 8 million visitors each year.


Rory Jeffes, general manager of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, believes that the Sydney Opera House will make a "turnaround" via this renovation and become one of the world's concerts with the best sound effects.


Non-permanent residents who have lived in Beijing for more than six months and have a stable and legal employment or accommodation or conditions for continuous schooling in Beijing can apply for a residence permit.


Recently, the launch of implementation details of "Residence Permit Provisional Regulations" indicates that the "temporary residence permit" will be upgraded to "residence permit".


A responsible person of the relevant department said that the transition from the "temporary residence permit" to "residence permit" means that Beijing will shift its administration for non-permanent residents from the "management" to multi-directional services.


Today, a reporter learned from the State Administration of Taxation (SAT) that as of the end of June this year, the tax authorities at all levels have announced a total of 2,470 illegal "blacklist" cases.


It is understood that in July 2014, SAT took the first step in the central government departments to issue an Information Disclosure Methods For Major Tax Violations along with the Tax Credit Management Approach.


In addition to the illegal facts, legal basis, the handling and punishment of these cases, the basic information of the illegal parties and the relevant intermediaries will be included in the "blacklist" exposure.


Quality inspection, treasury, customs and other government departments also take relevant disciplinary measures against the "blacklist" parties.


"The credit repair mechanism is an important milestone in the construction of the tax credit system and even the credit system of the whole society, which indicates that the construction of our social credit system is becoming more and more mature."


"Environmental problems are embodied by the atmosphere, water and soil pollution, but the root still lies in the mode of production and living."


For example, the land development ratio of Jiangsu Province was up to 21% in 2015, ranking top among all provinces and autonomous regions of China.


Therefore, the problem of high pollution, heavy energy consumption and land occupation has not been fundamentally addressed in the transformation of production and life styles.


On the one hand, Jiangsu tops in the whole country from the perspective of the establishment achievement of ecological environment of all levels and classes. But on the other hand, the resource and environment pressure is heavy.


To solidly promote the ecological environment protection and governance, we need to fundamentally promote the transformation of production and lifestyle and promote the transformation of people's livelihood from the perspective of ecological civilization construction.


On the 11th day of the month, 42 wind turbine blades produced by Guodian Group was prepared to be shipped and exported to South Africa from the wharf of Lianyungang Port.


Since last year, Guodian Group has exported a total of 163 sets of wind power projects from Lianyungang Port to South Africa.


The third party company (non-Chinese company) commissioned by the Olympic Organizing Committee is located in the Sao Paulo state, Brazil, about 75 kilometers away from the city of Sao Paulo.


To urge the manufacturers to finish the production ASAP, the Chinese Consulate General in Sao Paulo sent specially-assigned persons to the manufacturer for in-depth work.


After overtime work of 30 hours, the manufacturer finally completed the Chinese flag production and loaded for transportation. The task was finished 4-5 working days in advance.


It is reported that the flags are expected to arrive in Rio on the 11th. Then the Olympic Organizing Committee will send the flags to various Olympic venues after receiving the flag. The whole process will be under the supervision of the Chinese embassy in Brazil.


(This newspaper) On the 10th day of the month, the Nantong Municipal Government held a series of cooperation activities at the Shanghai International Convention Center. More than 180 Shanghai enterprises were invited to participate. More than 20 Hu-Tong industry docking projects worth at least RMB 100 million saw on-site signing.


The 20 projects with simultaneous signing have a total investment of RMB 8.063 billion, involving new energy, new materials, modern services and other industries.


Qingdao is China's 12th and also Shandong's first trial city to use and trade emissions.


On the 11th day of the month, many companies came to the Qingdao Municipal Emissions Trading Center to submit emissions subscription. After acceptance, they shall pay fees.


The upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot officially kicked off. It will also be the first emissions trading in Shandong and the first city-level emissions trading in China.


In the morning of 11th day of the month, Zhao Xiuping, the General Manager of Qingdao Shuangtao Fine Chemical (Group) Co., Ltd. came to the trading center to submit emissions subscription.


Its plant in the old urban area of Qingdao came to a full halt and was moved to the new plant in Pingdu due to environmental reason.


After Zhao Xiuping submitted the application form and the construction project environmental impact report, etc., Qingdao Municipal Emissions Reserve and Trading Service Center began to review the application materials.


According to the collection standard determined by Qingdao price bureau and financial sector, the estimated initial emission fee is about 641,200 yuan. The working staff will finish review within 7 working days.


The upcoming first single transaction also indicates that Qingdao emissions trading pilot will officially kick off. It will also be the first emissions trading in Shandong and the first city-level emissions trading in China.


According to Zhao Xiuping, up to RMB 400 million has been invested in the current environmental protection. Such investment has a great impact on the enterprise management philosophy and social benefits and also opened up a space for the enterprise innovation management.


On the same day, Qingdao SF-XC-ZZ Coach Component Co., Ltd. also came to purchase emission rights for its project with an annual output of 4,200 interior accessories of high-speed rail and CRH.


The project is a mechanical processing enterprise. Its initial emission rate for the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and ammonia (NOX) are 0.514 tons/year and 0.052 tons/year, respectively.


The paid use and trading of Air Pollutant Emission Permits cover the city's key industrial enterprises for the production and supply of electricity and heat.


On January 1, 2016, the current pollutant discharging unit which obtained environmental impact assessment shall be exempt from expenditure of compensated use.


The obtaining of compensated emission right is not equal to the obtaining of illegal discharge, so companies cannot discharge pollutants at will.


Han Hongyan, deputy director of Qingdao Environmental Protection Bureau, introduces that companies of illegal and excessive sewage must be punished in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations. Illegal enterprises cannot be allowed to circumvent punishment via purchasing emission rights.


In other words, we need to crack down on environmental violations through legal means and severely punish the enterprises' over standard discharge behaviors, so as to protect the environment and public health.


Now for their own interests, enterprises have raised their enthusiasm of pollution control, cherished limited emissions and reduced emissions of pollutants.


With the economic interests drive, to reduce pollutants' discharge has shifted from the government's mandatory behavior into a conscious market behavior, so as to truly protect the environment, nature and public health.


Emission right, also known as "dumping right", means the right to discharge pollutants. It refers to the right for emitters to discharge pollutants to the environment in line with the law within the quota assigned by the government.


This right is essentially the right of the emitters to occupy, use and benefit from environmental capacity resources.


Next, under the premise that the total discharge of pollutants does not exceed the total allowable emission volume, the internal resources of pollution began to swap discharge capacities via currency exchange.


Since the proposition of emissions trading by American economist Dyers in 1968, it has been applied by the United States of America to the management of atmospheric and river pollution sources since the 1970s.


Since its pilot in China in 2007, it has been applied to 14 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities) including Zhejiang and Jiangsu.


According to the Ministry of Defense of Russia, in order to assist the air attack of the six strategic bombers on the "Islamic State" target in Syria, a number of Russian fighters lifted from the Syrian Mahmir Air Force base to provide support.


On February 22 this year, the United States and Russia reached a ceasefire agreement on the Syrian conflict. The ceasefire agreement will be implemented since February 27.


Under the agreement, the ceasefire does not include a military strike against terrorist organizations including "Islamic State" and "Salvation Front ", which were identified by the United Nation Security Council.


Russia will continue to build the relevant military infrastructure in the base and the living conditions of the Russian soldiers will be protected correspondingly.


He also said that if the extremist forces were not hit, these forces will be extended to Russia.


Although Russia and the West did not reach an agreement on the cooperation against the extremist forces of Syria, Russia would strengthen cooperation with Syria, Iran and Iraq in this regard.


In September 2015, Russia, at the invitation of the Syrian government, began a military strike against Syrian extremist forces.


On March 15 this year, Russia's major military forces began to evacuate, but the Russian side promised to continue to retain the military base in Heimi Mimi and the naval base in Tartus.


In the case of renovating old houses and successful startup in his hometown, He Peijun is making a good example: to inherit a 100-year old house and tell a story about the land heritage.


Today, 100,000 people on average visit Zhushan each year, bringing a variety of ideas or seeking inner peace.


In fact, the relationship between the village and the city should companionship with, just like mother and child. No matter strong or weak. There is no need for any party to be governed by the other party. Such a relationship is warm.


There is no fixed pattern of rural development, but it is quite difficult to just rely on spontaneous rural changes. One of the most important changes is to let the right people go to villages.


Shanghai Songjiang District Traffic Control Department recently used electronic police to monitor whether the driver plays mobile phone while driving. As a result, more than 30 cases were detected in a week.


With the popularity of smart phones, mobile phones become more and more funny. WeChat, microblogging and even games, shopping on Taobao have become normal. It seems that many people cannot leave the phone for a moment, and cannot stop even when driving.


According to "Road Traffic Safety Act", mobile phones playing are banned and defined as "behavior preventing safe driving".


Unfortunately, due to some reasons such as the large number of illegal cases and difficulty in obtaining evidences, those people have never been punished and make the laws become a kind of decoration.


If the traffic control department can be determined to declare war to the mobile phone playing behavior while driving and normalize such measures, such illegal behaviors will surely be curbed.


The public security organ shall be strict with household registration management by gradually establishing electronic and paper files for people without Hukou (household registration) and ensure the completeness and validity.


The public security organ shall promptly notify the relevant departments of the registration of people without Hukou.


The policy measures that are inconsistent with the idea of this implementation will receive a centralized cleanup. They should be corrected and abolished if necessary.


In the collective greenhouse of Donglin village of Taicang City, the 48-year-old Wang Xuefen is leading workers to pear spray pesticides on pear trees.


There are 150 acres of orchards and more than 10 species, but only 12 workers plus a technical engineer are ok.


Last year, the income was a total of RMB 50,000. I cannot earn so many if i work in the factory because of such age.


Last year, the income of Donglin village reached RMB 22 million, of which total agricultural income accounted for nearly a half.


According to Su Qifang, the village secretary, per capita land cultivation area increases each year. 50 mu (a unit of area, one "mu"=0.0667 hectares) in the beginning and over 100 mu now. The revenue per mu increases every year and the income of professional farmers also have room for growth every year.


With shares quantifying to each villager, the highlight of the rural collective economic reform is to be clear about the property rights of rural collective management and exploring political and economic separation.


In July 2015, on Anzhen Street of Wuxi Xishan District, 14 rural economic cooperation organizations worked with the village committee to implement "sub-account management". The village committee implemented rural public affairs management while the cooperative organizations were mainly engaged in business.


With two accounts for two institutions, this can prevent the village cadres from participating in collective asset management corruption.


Zhu Baoping, deputy director of the Jiangsu Provincial Agriculture Committee, said that the next step of Jiangsu government is to continue to promote the reform of community cooperation system, encourage farmers to jointly develop and establish a village-level democratic power operation mechanism.


According to Zhu Baoping, they should further move forward the reform, engage in community shares cooperation, quantify the assets to members, fix it to farmers and produce clear property rights.


Through the Internet +, we shall provide farmers with the rights to know, participate in decision-making and democratic management and turn such rights into standardized mechanism of cooperation.


At present, the new collective economy in southern Jiangsu village mainly consists of four development modes, including asset leasing, enterprise stock, agricultural development and joint development.

Xiamen girl Zhang Binbin: "handsome hands" encourage her to start shooting career, which saw several "reverse"


Zhang Donghong, a villager of the East Park Village, Xiamen Xiang'an District, changed his 29-inch old TV into a 65-inch TV just a few days before.


The ordinary farmer has a daughter, named Zhang Binbin. She is the one to win sanzi final silver medal of Olympic Games Women's 50-meters rifle games for China in the evening of the eleventh.


In the evening of the 11th day of the month, just in front of this new TV set, the Zhang Donghong couple and their dozens of relatives and friends have witnessed the magic process for the couple's daughter to catch up and reverse from almost being eliminated in the preliminaries to almost winning.


At the game, Zhang Binbin was ranked in the middle and lower reaches and it seemed she was still quite far away from the final.


But her parents and friends did not give up, kept watching the live and saw other players finish the game. Zhang Binbin raised her ranks all the way and finally came to the final. At this time, a burst of cheers broke out in her home.


In the final, Zhang Binbin also started from lagging behind and shot more stably and won the silver medal with just 0.2 rings behind the champion.


This year, the 27-year-old Zhang Binbin, in the 16-year shooting career, has actually missed the silver medal for several times.


According to her mother Zhang Xiaolong, her daughter sent a few "little persuaders" from her village at their hesitation.


These little persuaders are girls and boys of her village who were recommended to attend the training at the same time, including Zhang Binbin's cousin.


Just after coming to Xiamen team, Zhang Binbin once again took the initiative to return to Xiang'an school because of her family difficulties.


But after the repeated efforts of her enlightening teacher, Zhang Binbin returned to Xiamen team.


And after she came into the provincial team, Zhang Binbin returned home because she found it almost hopeless to enter the national team after a long time.


This time, not only the coach Zhang Yajie, but also the leaders and coach of Xiamen shooting archery sports center and Fujian provincial team came to her home. With their efforts, Zhang Binbin was finally persuaded to return to the provincial team.


Just at yesterday's game, the Xiamen girl achieved several reversals of the shooting with her insistence.


"Each coach has his own method to choose the potential player. I decided to take her once I saw her beautiful hands."


Zhang Donghong also recalled, in the training test, although the results of her daughter were not the best, her rings were very stable, which is also an important reason for Zhang Binbin to attract coaches.


During the training process of Zhang Binbin, it was the input of this farmer girl that impressed Zhang Yajie most.


He recalled that after Zhang Binbin came into the Xiamen shooting team more than a year later, the team carried out a long shot of gun training, requiring players not to move for half an hour.


Zhang Xiaolong told reporters that her daughter has always been a quiet and well-behaved child, with the hobby of painting and producing toys.


"I used to make clothes and do some sowing jobs. Binbin picked up some scraps to make her own dolls."


She said, her daughter often sewed hand toys. Plus, she is good at painting and could make animated toys from the doll's facial features to clothing.


As an athlete, Zhang Binbin and her family are separate more than being together. As she can only return home during festivities, she mainly contacts family members by phone in other time.


According to her parents, no matter meeting in person or talking by phone, Zhang Binbin seldom talked about her hard work but more about some happy things.


Because they cannot often see their daughter, they put away the paintings of her childhood and honors of consecutive years.


Zhang Xiaolong showed the animation show of her daughter to the reporter, "She should keep drawing instead if she did not become shooter."


In the living room on the second floor of Zhang Binbin, there was a cupboard filled with medals and certificates.


Zhang Donghong put away the medals neatly and placed all certificates into files for storage. "This is honor made by Binbin after a dozen of years' efforts. We feel quite cherished."

According to a Hong Kong Oriental Daily report made on August 12, the current diamond sales in Mainland China were accused of three major problems, including the false marking of diamond clarity to raise sales price, false diamond weight and unguaranteed aftersales, etc.


Antwerp is one of the world's largest diamond trading centers. The diamond cutting technology of local artisans is well-known. All diamonds on sale have undergone rigorous identification, deeply welcomed by the mainland ladies.


"A small cloth bag, holding in one's hand, such light-weighted, is worth of almost one million yuan", a woman surnamed Liu who participated in the purchase of diamonds told of her experience in Antwerp last June to the mainland media.


She buried the diamond in her lingerie and carried it all day along, including when she went to toilet and took bath.


She said the diamond she bought in Antwerp was priced about RMB 55,000 per gram and diamond of the same quality was retail-priced about RMB 111,000 in Xia'men.


Recently, she sold the diamond with 120% more than the price she bought and earned two hundred thousand yuan.


According to the provisions of the Mainland Customs, diamonds are neither supplies nor necessities during the trip and thus belong to the scope of goods. So such diamond should be declared at entry and exit. Otherwise, it shall be classified as smuggling. People may be sentenced to jail.


According to foreign media reports, on the 10th day of the month of the local time, the British Prime Minister's Downing Street announced that British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will go to Switzerland to spend the summer vacation, but did not disclose the specific place.


According to some media, after the British referendum off Europe, the new British Prime Minister chose to spend her vacation on the "neutral country", Swiss on the European continent. This is symbolic.


The British "Guardian" commented that the symbolic neutrality nature of the Swiss played a role in the choice of the British Prime Minister's first resort.


British "Daily Telegraph" commented that Teresa Mei chose to take a vacation in Switzerland. This is the first time that the British Prime Minister chose to go vacation in Swiss after Margaret Thatcher.


The choice of these two female prime ministers is quite a contrast to the hot place which Blair and Cameron, the two male prime ministers like to go to.


It is reported that the new British Prime Minister Teresa Mei will return to London on August 24. A series of important work and activities will be waiting for her.


The British parliament will resume on September 5. The subject matter covers the second Brexit referendum required by the internet.

There are 1,325 existing intangible cultural heritage projects in Huangshan. Its number and quantity ranked first in Anhui province.


As the inheritance of intangible cultural heritage projects of Anhui province mainly relies on oral and face-to-face passage, many intangible cultural heritage projects are on the verge of failing to be handed down from past generations. So the application of digital technology for conservation is imperative.

China's Mars program is coming


China Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never occurred in foreign countries.


China's Mars exploration launch target is to step around, land and patrol at one time. Such task has considerable difficulty.


Because the Mars probe can encounter a time window in 26 months, experts are closely working on the project plan and try to launch the first Mars probe in 2020.


According to Xu Dazhe, although China's aircraft has entered a deep space, it is still essential to finish the task of Mars exploration. The detection of Mars means that China has stepped into the deep space exploration era in a true sense.


"Every two or three years, there is a chance that Mars is closest to Earth. And at this point, it is most energy efficient to launch the vehicle."


"Taking into account the mass of Mars detectors, it will be the job of China's Long March 5 carrier rocket to complete the launch mission."


China's Mars exploration mission aims to achieve surrounding, landing and patrolling at one time, which has never occurred in foreign countries. There was one time of surrounding and landing before in foreign countries, but the landing failed.


Mars exploration involves a lot of technical areas. In particular, although the rover is a space detector, it has a distinctive feature compared with the general space detector.


In other words, the Mars probe should be capable of determining the driving route and equipped with the ability to find obstacles.


According to Pang Zhihao, a researcher of the fifth institute of China's Aerospace Science and Technology Group, the reason for human being to favor Mars exploration is because Mars detection has significant scientific and technical meanings and it even matters to the future of human beings.


Currently, the Mars has become the planet with the highest degree of human research. The history of human beings to use space detectors for Mars exploration almost goes across the entire history of human space exploration.


Therefore, the human beings hope that one day on the Mars to establish a base of residence, and ultimately to Mars immigration, it turned into a second home of mankind.


A large number of signs also show that the Mars is likely to be the same as the current Earth, only after billions of years of evolution into the atmosphere thin, low temperature, water depletion and so on.


Therefore, the detection or manned landing on the Mars for research can help propose a pre-arranged planning to prevent the earth from becoming the second Mars which is difficult for human beings to inhabit.


As of June 2016, the world conducted a total of 114 lunar explorations, including 43 Mars detection missions.


However, ever since the 1990s, a total of 18 human explorations have been carried out and only 14 lunar detections have been conducted.


There are currently five Mars orbiters and two Mars rovers at work, but only one lunar orbiter and one lunar lander are at work.


World space powers have developed a detection plan with the Mars system as target. So we can see the current Mars detection is hotter than that of moon detection.


On Nov. 5, 2013, India launched the first Mars probe "Mangalian", and has become Asia's first country for successful detection of the Mars.


"Mangalian" is used to study the surface, the atmosphere and mineral characteristics of the Mars and explore whether there are signs of methane and life on the Mars.


The hardest part of the mission is that the probe just has one chance before entering the Martian atmosphere for aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration.


According to Sun Zezhou, the chief designer of a Mars detector of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation, the Mars exploration task is confronted with many technical challenges.


The atmospheric pressure of the Mars is very low, only 1% of the Earth's surface atmospheric pressure, with high uncertainty.


Scientists have not had a thorough understanding of Mars factors such as its changes and storm characteristics.


A dust storm similar to the Earth's dust is often formed in the Mars in the summer, which will lead to a sharp decline in solar energy. So a "sleep" mode must be designed for the Mars rover and let it wait patiently until the disappearance of dust storms.


At the same time, the Martian atmosphere has a reducing effect on sunlight, which poses a problem for the energy supply for Mars detection.


This requires that the detector's sun wing area to be larger, and need to constantly adjust, and strive to align with the sun direction.


In addition, since the gravity of the Mars is only 38% of that of the earth and much higher than that of the Moon surface, so the probe requires higher power.


"The core and the most difficult part of the Mars exploration mission are the aerodynamic shape and parachute deceleration process after the probe enters Martian atmosphere. There is just one chance to ensure success."


According to Sun Ze, it must rely on the detector to complete the entire process because the distance between the Earth and the Mars is quite large.


Because there is not so much propellant to offset the high speed, the slowdown should rely on the atmosphere of the Mars while landing the Mars. However, it is quite difficult to simulate the atmosphere of the Mars on earth.


Pang Zhihao said, in general, the way to detect the Mars is similar to the way to detect the moon. The entire process is also "surrounding, landing, patrolling and returning" to achieve the goal of manned landing on the Mars.


Because the distance between the Mars and the earth is larger than that between the Moon and Earth, it needs to overcome a series of more complex technical difficulties before the Mars detection.


According to Taiwanese media reports, Lin Quan, the head of Taiwan's Executive Yuan, announced yesterday morning, "Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations by political parties and their accompanying organizations" will take effective since today.


KMT Vice Chairman Zhan Qixian said, "Kuomintang, with a hundred years of history, will step down otherwise without social commitment and responsibility."


Lin Quan stressed that if the political party, accompanying organization or trustees are in violations of the regulations which prohibit provisions ban, the Commission will investigate and punish "according to the law".


Lin Quan also announced that Hong Peigen, "Deputy Director of the Independent", will serve as the vice chairman of the Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee.


He said that Gu Lixiong will be the most appropriate candidate for the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations. The experience of Hong Peigen who dealt with the major cases will serve as the foundation for the committee to uncover the related Ill-gotten Party Assets.


Zhan Qixian said that, as long as there are party assets today, no one will give you social donations. So if the party were all confiscated away, then Kuomintang can just ask for social support and sponsorship, "You will have chance to go when there are no assets."


Zhan Qixian also stressed that even if the Ill-gotten Party Assets Handling Regulations goes into effect and the Kuomintang party assets are not fully confiscated, the rest will continue to be confiscated as promised, the party asset will go null and the party will start from scratch.


Original title: Suit launched by "corridor doctor" Lan Yuefeng against CCTV host Wang Zhi'an for reputation infringement fails in instance judgment


The legal evening news: Because the CCTV host Wang Zhi'an published his remarks against the "corridor doctor" event on microblogging, Lan Yuefeng brought Wang Zhi'an and Beijing Micro Dream Chuangke Network Technology Co., Ltd. to the court.


Yesterday afternoon, Haidian court sentenced the case and the verdict said that Wang Zhi'an and Micro Dream Company did not constitute the infringement and dismissed the Lan Yuefeng for all the claims.


At the beginning of 2014, CCTV reporter Wang Zhi'an found after his survey that although Lan Yuefeng was sitting in the corridor for more than 600 days and was shaped as the tragic hero suppressed by the media, these reports had a lot of false information.


On March 29, 2014, the "corridor doctor" program produced by CCTV news survey broadcasted.


All information about the so-called over-medical treatment reported by Lan Yuefeng to the media do not have any evidence support.


In the microblogging with real-name certification, Wang Zhi'an also said that the reason for Lan Yuefeng to become this is because of his stubborn characters and paranoid personality".


Lan Yuefeng claimed that Wang Zhi'an should delete the microblogging and apologized to him and made compensation of 100,000 yuan for the mental damage solatium.


At the time of the trial, the two sides argued whether Wang Zhian violated the reputation right of Lan Yuefeng.


Highlight of the 12th day of the month: at the beginning of Track and Field Events, the Chinese team is quite busy and the women's football association aims to become the top four of the bicycle games


The bicycle game is expected to realize the "zero breakthrough" in the Olympic gold medal while the Women's World Cup girls will challenge Germany team, the world champion winner for twice and are expected to become the top four.


Wang Zhen was quite outstanding in the two races. He won silver medal for the athletics world championship held in Beijing last year and was upgraded to the individual project champion in the world championship this May.


According to foreign media reports, Zhang Huizhen, the 27-year-old Korean archery female player won the gold medal in the women's archery individual tournament. This is the second scoring of Olympic gold medal following the team competition. This made she become a double winner.


Zhang Huizhen is considered as a late bloomer. She regrets about not winning the last session of the London Olympic Games tickets before, but now she proudly stands on the top of the Rio Olympic podium.


Zhang Huizhen won the gold medal in Lisa Wenglu, a total score of 6-2 in the women's archery finals at the Samba Boulevard in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.


She did archery for the first time in the fourth grade of primary school. She won the first individual tournament gold medal when she was 27 in 2014. So she is a late bloomer.


Zhang Huizhen recalled, "My performance before high school was too bad to enable me to participate in the national competition.


Zhang Huizhen was ranked the fourth at the London Olympic Games qualification trials. Unfortunately, she lost the Olympic admission and can just watch her colleague and good friend Qi Pubei score two gold medals.


Zhang Huizhen talked about his gold winning after the women's individual awards ceremony of archery. "I tried to shoot one by one until the last. Maybe it is because this brings me good results and makes me contented."


The 28-year-old Korean archery "No.1", and the London Olympic Games archery individual tournament winner Qi Fubei won the bronze medal.


Qi Fubei was defeated by Zhang Huizhen in the semifinals and competed for the bronze medal with the Mexican player Alexandra Valencia.


Qi Fubei shed tears after she knew she won the blonde medal. At this time, we can know her pressure.


Firstly, the coaching staff accumulated rich experience in his gradual study. Secondly, it needs scientific training, which should be accumulated over time.


The Archery team helped the team players focus and remain unbiased via military training and going through the cemetery during night.


Although not yet confirmed, it is said by many sources that Apple's 2016 autumn conference will be held in September, and iPhone7 would really be launched into the market.


Although Apple did not respond, there are news release about the function and configuration of the new iPhone. There are even the images of iPhone7 "real machine model" on the internet.


The new generation of iPhone is really "eye-catching", hot and hard-to-get. If you want to buy the genuine product at the first time, you must choose a good channel, for example, Suning.


This has exacerbated people's disappointment of the new iPhone, "It is lengthened, but cannot be used to cast holographic images! This generation of iPhone is so terrible."


iPhone7, just like other iPhones, brings countless secret before birth.


In addition, there are a number of sources claiming that the new generation of iPhone will have the 3.5mm headphone jack cancelled, and adopt Bluetooth connection and charging interface instead, which will provide space for Apple to add a second speaker.


Another evidence to support this news is that as early as 2014, Apple will allow headset manufacturers to produce headset products via producing charging interface.


Another evidence to confirm this message is that Apple allows the headphone manufacturer to produce headphone via the connection of charge interface.


Whether these news are true or false will not be unveiled until the 2016 Apple autumn conference.


But this does not prevent the industry insiders to be optimistic about the prospects of iPhone7 - many people think that iPhone7 will be likely to become the last major upgrade of Apple's iPhone series, although it can be seen from the data released by the market research institution IDC that the market share of iPhone will decline to some degree.


Among them, Goldman Sachs ranked Apple's stock to be the rating of "buying" while BMO analyst thought that iPhone7 will obtain a historical high sales achievement.


Meanwhile, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan also said that Apple's future revenue growth will likely be more than 20%, which is entirely due to the introduction of iPhone7.


7% of respondents said they have the plan to buy iPhone7, while only 4% people had the plan to buy iPhone6.


It is understood that currently 20% of user groups of iPhone6 or 6Plus have such a plan to purchase iPhone7. This is a quite high proportion.


Secondly, according to expert analysis, most of the iPhone fans like to replace their own iPhone mobile phone.


According to statistics, among all iPhone users, about 26% of users have not changed their phones for 2 years. That is, almost 120 million users of iPhones have been using the same iPhone for 2 years.


According to media, Taiwan witnessed several earthquakes during the production period of iPhone7. "The destruction of TSMC production facilities is beyond imagination and may impact the initial supply of iPhone7."


Supply and demand contradiction will affect the average user, so it is time to choose a good channel and purchase the genuine iPhone7 for the first time.


According to informed sources, recently, Suning executives and Apple frequently meet, with the purpose to prepare adequate supply.


Operators have negotiated with Suning. So it is foreseeable that, with the depth of cooperation between the two sides, lower prices and more intimate services will inevitably bring to users.


"With the lowest price, the consumer may "buy iPhone7 with just 7 yuan per day".


Adequate supply and a variety of concessions will alleviate the pressure of iPhone7 buying. Suning's logistics will change such good feeling into more intuitive sense of experience.


Maybe you'll get a call at midnight. "Hello, Suning Tesco, your iPhone7 is here."


The organizers hope that the local people can understand more about the history of Chinese culture via the cultural relics exhibition, thereby enhancing the mutual understanding and friendship between the two peoples.


As part of the European tour, Barcelona's "Ming Dynasty Heritage Exhibition" will continue until early October.

According to foreign media reports, the "green pool" incident of Rio Olympic Games gained much attention because its diving pool water was changed from blue to green.


However, on the morning of the 10th day of the month, the water of the match pool adjacent to the water pool also turned green.


Australian water polo contestant said that his eyes feel tingling and would like to shed tears.


Previously, Rio officials confirmed the situation of water greening, and said the water color is due to the weakening of alkaline reasons and will not affect the athlete's health.


However, after Australian players achieved success with the Japanese delegation in the water polo pool, they said their eyes felt pricking.


When the water of diving pool turned green, the hosting party worked overtime to deal with the diving pool problems in the evening of the 9th day of the month and found the rapid change of water polo pool in the morning of the 10th day of the month.


During the competition period of the Australia and Japanese team, the environmental conditions of the water polo pond gradually worsened, but the official stressed that they would manage to return the water quality of the two pools to their original colors on the 11th day of the month.


Mario Andrada, the spokesman of Rio Olympic Games said, "The alkalinity of water quality in the diving pool firstly turned weak after the yesterday afternoon".


"We learned about a series of causes that could cause discoloration of water and result in the alkalinity of water quality."


The water sports center conducted a series of tests on water quality, and hundreds of divers and swimmers used the swimming pool to determine whether the water quality meets criteria. "


"We have been following the normal procedure these days, but we may have overlooked the impact of more athletes on water quality."


"But the change in water color certainly has no effect on health, especially for athletes."


"This independent team confirms our assessment and confirms the measures we have taken to restore the normal color and normal chemical status of the pool."


"We had hoped that the pool would return to normal color in the morning, but the speed of recovery was affected by the rain."

Urumqi normalizes the operating order of travel tourism market and regulates that travel agencies must sign contracts with tourists


Currently, Xinjiang has entered peak tourist season. In order to regulate the management order of tourism FIT market, yesterday Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Detachment worked with the law enforcement detachment of Urumqi Transportation Authority to investigate and deal with the non-normative travel vehicles existent in the tourism FIT market, and the low contract signing between the travel agency and tourists.


At 8 O'clock of yesterday morning, around 10 buses packed with tourists parked around the Kempinski Hotel. These vehicles are mostly individual group that went for Tianchi One Day Tour.


"Hello, I am from the Urumqi City Tourism Bureau. Did you sign with the travel agency?"


Yu Bin, the working staff of law enforcement detachment of Urumqi Transportation Authority explained, "The foreign tourist bus and bus line worked on tourist transport project in Urumqi market, but they did not have qualification."


"A fine of 30,000 to 100,000 yuan will be imposed for operation beyond scope. The driver who did not have a qualification certificate will pay RMB 2,000 for fine."


It is reported that the Urumqi City Tourism Law Enforcement Department has investigated the places including West Park and Hongshan where the independent travelers are centralized.

On the morning of August 12, the State Council Information Office held a press conference on the operation of the national economy in July 2016.


Sheng Yunyun, spokesman of National Bureau of Statistics and head of National Economic Statistics Division said that, in July, the part index number of national economy slowed relatively but still operated in the reasonable range.


According to the data of National Bureau of Statistics, the fixed asset investment growth, total imports and other data in July have come down.


Sheng Laiyun said, as for the national economy in July, I would like to use the words of Premier, "the shape is volatile and the potential is still good". This is a better way to summarize the characteristics of the economic operation in July.


He explained that "the shape of the fluctuations" refers to the fall after rise of some economic indicators growth rate in July.


In July, the domestic and international economy is still in the deep adjustment, the international situation is complex and volatile and the world economic recovery is less than expected, so the export pressure is still relatively heavy.


As for the domestic situation, the whole economy is still in the critical stage of adjustment, adjustment labor pains are releasing and the economy is under great pressure, so some indicators are still fluctuating.


Sheng Laiyun pointed out that there was a special case in July, with serious floods, high temperature and hot weather which have brought some impact on production and operation of some areas.


According to the recent report of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, more than 60 million people were affected, with direct economic losses of more than 200 billion yuan.


From the view of industrial, investment and transport-related indicators, these areas are affected to varying degrees.


The cargo turnover growth rate in July fell back 3.6 percentage and floods on these areas have a certain impact on traffic.


From these factors, it is quite normal to have some fluctuations in some indicators. And such thing is expected.


He said, "The potential is still good" means that despite the fallback of economic growth, the overall economic performance is stable and steady. And the good momentum has not changed.


In July, CPI rose by 1.8%, with a month-on-month rise of 0.2%. From January to July, CPI rose by 2.1%, so the overall price situation is stable.


According to the statistics of hot weather in the districts and counties by the portal of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Meteorology, in addition to Youyang, the rest of the city can receive different degrees of high temperature allowance.


At present, at least 28 provinces in the country have clearly defined the standard of the allowance, but the standards issued by provinces and municipalities are not the same, and people in Chongqing receive the allowance based on the count of high-temperature working days.


In case of temperature between 35 and 37 ℃, people can receive allowance of no less than 10 yuan per day. In case of temperature above 37℃, people are released with the allowance of not less than 15 yuan.


In case of temperature above 40℃, staff working in high temperature can receive up to 20 yuan per day of allowance (but for laborers who enjoy the high temperature job allowance).


In accordance with this standard, people in Kaizhou which has the highest number of high temperature can receive 330 yuan. And people in Chengkou with the least days of high temperature can receive 80 yuan. And the maximum temperature of Youyang did not meet the high temperature standards, so there is no high temperature allowance.


In the past, many companies adopt cool drinks as high temperature allowance. The city safety supervision bureau deemed that this behavior does not meet the current regulation.


Employer shall not deduct or reduce the wages of workers in case of terminating work and reducing working hours in high temperature weather.


The city's Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that if employees did not receive high temperature allowance while working under high temperature, they may fight for the legitimate rights and interests via the labor dispute mediation organization or dial 12333 for complaint.


If the employing unit refuses to pay the high temperature allowance, the laborer may lodge a complaint with the competent department of human resources social security at the county level or above.


At the same time, because the high temperature allowance is part of the wage and not welfare, such allowance shall be included in the total wages, with tax deducted.


So the high temperature allowance is not within the minimum wage, it must be issued in cash and not substituted by physical objects such as drinks.

Gracia is a cute female toucan, exuding the breath of tropical rain forest.


In Costa Rica, one of the Central American countries, Toucan Gracia and its story have long been known.


At the press conference on August 10, after postoperative rehabilitation, Gresham finally appeared and showed people its brand new 3D printing plastic beak.


This toucan, which had its beak broken and was dying just one year and a half ago, finally regained its new life.


This day not only announced that it has restored health by 100%, but also signaled its moving into the luxury aviary to meet its human friends.


The newcomer Grecia was slightly shy initially, but soon became lively, rolling in the basin frolic and eating grapes with a new beak.


In order to remind people that it has suffered damage, the technical staff did not give it a new beak color, but to retain the original white color of the 3D print material.


The beak is a thin layer of horny sheath, which is hollow inside and only has some of the thin bone to support.


Despite this internal reinforcement, the toucan's beak is fragile and may be broken when it is hurt.


Animal rescue center, ornithologist and a US 3D printing company worked together to prepare several "test beak" for Gracia and finally built a "perfect beak" for it.


Now Gracia has been able to use the new beak to drink water, eat, and even peck fine grains.


"The design of the finished product costs about two months and it just takes 4-5 hours to print it."


"3D printing is not the future technology but really enters into your life." Thomas Lange, the chairman of US SG3D printing company said in an interview with Xinhua International.


In January 2015, Gracia, lying on a farm in the town of Alajuela in the middle of Costa Rica, was found with blood covering on its body.


At that time, its beak was cruelly broken by a group of young people. It was completely unable to eat and dying.


After the tragedy of the Gracia was reported by the media, there are a tide of animal anti-abuse call occurring inside and outside Costa Rica.


People demand to establish more rigorous animal protection law to enhance the punishment against abusers.


People came spontaneously to try their utmost to help Gracia restore its life before hurting.


Even the inventor of the 3D printing technology, Chuck Hull, is also involved in the design of the Gracia beak.


"The situation of Gracia is very special, and its remaining part of the beak is less than 1 centimeter, so there are many difficulties in installing the new beak."


"We first scanned Gracia and then designed and produced an extended prosthesis slightly longer than the rest of its beak and fixed on its beak with glue."


"This can reduce the risk of further intrusive damage to Gracia," Lange told Xinhua International.


Before installing the prosthesis, the staff cleared the broken beak of Gracia every day to prevent infection.


Thousands of miles away, the story of the Toucan Gracia touched the famous documentary director Paula El Reidia and the news channel producer John Hoffman.


They recorded a little bit of the process of installing a new beak, and recorded a documentary "The Country of Toucan", which was played this month on the Animal Planet Channel.


The documentary "The State of the Toucan" shows people how a small Toucan has changed a country and how people get involved in the fight against torture of animals.


Core Tip: Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the "teapot" of China's small independent refinery.


August 12 report on Cankaoxiaoxi website: Japan's largest oil company JX Energy believes that "China's export expansion is one of the reasons for the market downturn."


Japanese oil companies expressed vigilance to the rise of Chinese oil companies, especially known as the "teapot" of China's small independent refinery.


China's oil products are gradually close to Japan's oil products because the Chinese government has strengthened environmental protection regulations.


Before obtaining the import license for crude oil, "teapot refinery" generally refines oil from the heavy oil, which has high sulfur content and is imported from Russia.


The petroleum products are poor in quality due to high sulfur content and become one of the causes of environmental pollution.


After obtaining crude oil import license, "teapot refinery" can import Oman crude oil and Russian crude oil, which have low sulfur content and improved petroleum products.


East Fuel General Oil Company said, "With China's domestic oil product quality standards continuing to improve, the refining capacity of the equipment also increased.


As a result, the quality of oil products exported from China gradually rivalled that of Japan (the world's highest quality).


According to JX Energy, "After the end of 2015, China began to export high-quality light oil to Australia." Such light oil products are competitive with Japanese products on the Asian market.


Although the "Japanese high quality oil" falls into a crisis, the Japanese oil companies just adopted the strategy of "exporting to profitable areas while being concerned about the market".


As China's exports of petroleum products have a huge impact on the Asian market, teapot refinery got more attentions.

UV not only tans your skin but also sunburns it, so how to make the skin go through the military training, without sunburn?


Sunblock is generally marked with SPF and PA on the package. SPF refers to Sun Protection Function and is targeted at UVB. The common SPF index includes 15, 30, 50, etc.


The product marked with PA is for UVA, so that sunblock will play a more effective role. Usually, the intensity of PA is represented with +. An extra + indicates extension of effective protection time.


Water-based sunblock with a strong penetration is often applied to oily skin. Sunscreen spray is also a good choice.


Creamy sunscreen is often applied to dry skin. The classification of neutral skin generally has no strict rules. Any kind of skin care products are burden to the sensitive skin. So it is recommended to choose pure physical sunscreen products.


Remember to apply sunblock half an hour in advance, because sunscreen products take time to completely penetrate into the skin.


Because you are exposed to sun longer during the military training, you have to apply the sunscreen products once every two hours to lengthen the effect. So keep doing it.


As the skin has just been stimulated by the sun's sake, do not immediately use whitening products after returning from military training.


After exposure under the blazing sun for quite a long time, please wrap the ice with towel to ease the sunburned skin and alleviate the local heat if condition allowed.

During some nights, the ionized layer is full of free electrons, which means that the radio signal can go further.


According to the report of Popular Science, an American monthly website, on August 11, the US Air Force was interested in copying this effect.


Although the stable ionizing layer with a large number of free electrons may help people listen to the radio at the edge of a university radio station, but this may not be the interest of the US Air Force.


Ionization layer full of electrons indicated the radio used by the military has a larger range of broadcasts. In addition, it may prevent the global positioning system (GPS) signal from the solar storm.


The final goal may be to build a series of cube satellite according to the requirement. They may enhance ionization layer when necessary.


But firstly, the team that signed contract with the air force must prove that the scientific principles will work.


Industry data showed that the total size of coal production in 2015 was close to 6 billion tons and the national coal production overcapacity reached 1.8 billion tons.


Over the past decade, the State Council has issued a total of five notices for the elimination of excessive and backward production capacity.


Although the first four notices are not directly involved with coal industry, the target industry is directly related with coal industry.


From last November to this January, the price of Qinhuangdao 5500 kcal steam coal lingers at 370 yuan/ton and 90% of the coal enterprises fell into a loss.

In this regard, Kuang Xianming, head of the Economic Research Institute of the China (Hainan) Reform and Development Institute, conducted an analysis and interpretation.


Kuang Xianming: overcapacity cut roused the high concerns to various industries. The report card of the overcapacity cut of the coal industry announced today make everyone feel worried indeed.


These three superficial factors reflect the reason behind the relative lagging behind of our growth pattern change. That is, the government-led growth has not yet been fundamentally changed.


Second, it is also directly related with the force of local government. During the overcapacity cut process, the funds and the corresponding supporting measures should be in place. From this point of view, the differences are indeed relatively large among different regions.


Thirdly, some of the provinces that are relatively slow in progress may face greater risks if they seek acceleration in progress in the second half of the year.


In this case, relying on the central allowance to raise funds to promote the process of production capacity may have a negative impact.


First, the overcapacity cut is not a simple cap control.


Our goal is to eliminate the backward production capacity, promote the optimization of the structure and restructure the new format of the entire coal industry.


During the process of overcapacity cut deploying, the local government must combine the production capacity and the transformation and upgrading of the coal industry to develop the relevant service industry.


Second, in order to complete this year's overcapacity cut task within this year, we must give full play to the power of administrative supervision.


Finally, we should strengthen the role of social security.


Because the market is directly related to the employment problem, we have to strengthen the employment skills training of employees.


"The reason for the ranking decline is that Brazilian GDP growth is expected to worsen in the medium term."


In 2015, Brazil's participation in global direct investment was 3.7%, down from 5.7% in 2014.


The International Investment Attractiveness Index of Credit Suisse Bank includes four sub-indices: infrastructure, economic outlook, business environment and direct investment.


In 2015, Brazil's international direct investment was $64.6 billion, down from $73.1 billion in 2014.


Last year, Brazil's "green investment" (in the investment model of building factories abroad) was $17.9 billion, a year-on-year fall of 2.1%.


"There are 288 'green land investment' projects in Brazil, with an average annual rise of 314 from 2003 to 2014".


However, in the first half of 2016, the international direct investment in Brazil had reached $33.8 billion, an increase of almost 10 per cent compared to the same period last year.


Title: Canadian police killed IS supporters: homemade bomb attacks downtown preparations near the end


The taxi company said the taxi was dispatched to the Dreyfus before the police arrived.


Canadian police said at a news conference on Wednesday that the information received by the police included the "martyrdom video" sent by the young man to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation. According to the video, the young man will launch strike.


According to the German voice, in the video, a man wearing a black Barakella hat is reading the "Koran", referred to the crime against Muslims, and vowed to attack a Canadian city sooner.


He said in the video, the attack will occur within 72 hours, and in the rush hour.


The incident is the first time for the police to kill terror suspects before the incident after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came to power last year.


Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal branch channels Old Wanfu River and Beidaliu will charge tolls since September 1.


The two tributaries will conduct construction via social financing. The charges have been approved by the relevant provincial government departments.


The old Wanfu River channel flows through Jinxiang, Yu Tai and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 32.5 km.


According to the navigation needs, the old Wanfu River channel takes the mode of conservation and transformation. Dredging was conducted on the local depth and curve cut-off on the local sharp bend. Then the navigation conditions can be improved.


The channel flows through Jinxiang County, Rencheng area and then through the Nanyang Lake into the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal main channel, with a total length of 19 km.


The renovation project of the two waterway started construction in February 2011. The delivery inspection was conducted in January 2015. The investment construction and operation main body is Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center.


In accordance with the "loan construction and charging for repaying loan" principle, Jining City Anping Canal Logistics Service Center will collect channel tolls according to the charge standard approved by Shandong Provincial Price Bureau.


Among them, the basic toll is 1.75 yuan/dwt and mileage toll is 0.05 yuan/km dwt.


The toll collection date is from June 15, 2016 to June 14, 2019.


Reporters learned from Jining Port and Waterway Bureau that there are a total of 4 toll channels within Jining territory, including Zhushuihe Channel, Baima River Channel, Beidahang Channel and Laowanfu Channel.


These four channels are Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal tributary channels, which are upgraded and renovated in the way of social financing.


Zhushuihe Channel Upgrade Renovation Project is the first project adopting the mode of "government + market" for the infrastructure construction of river and ports within Shandong province. The government accounts for the major part of investment while social fund supplements the funding gap.


Baima River, the laowanfu River and Beidaliu River and other feeder routes adopt pure market operation.


The funds allocated by the state finance cannot meet the needs of the project construction and restrict the progress of the channel upgrade.


Social funds for the construction of public infrastructure are in line with national policy requirements and have become a way to break the bottleneck of funding.


Ning Zetao's performance in the 100 meters freestyle semi-final has made a lot of Chinese audience speechless.


Actually, this 50-meter freestyle is not the subject of Ning Zetao. His performance and best achievement in Kazan World Championships also indicate it is not possible for him to make breakthrough in this project.


Sure enough, Ta Kung Pao, an authoritative media in Hong Kong, revealed that the biggest reason for Ning Zetao to lose is that he has lost interest in swimming.


Many factors may have a great impact on his future ideas. He is now more interested in entering the entertainment circle.


After Kazan World Championships, Ning Zetao instantly become celebrity with his good look and excellent performance.


As a result, "national husband (a good match)", "fresh little meat", "gorgeous", etc. have become his label.


A variety of business activities came to him. He really have a golden flashing prospect.


In this case, that Ning Zetao chooses to withdraw and joins the entertainment circle, is not only his freedom, but also a seemingly viable way.


After all, he is only 23 years old. After a certain degree of study, he can perform some TV series with his popularity.


But Ning Zetao needs to see whether he is qualified enough compared with his predecessors.


At the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, the already 21-year-old Liu Xuan came to the end of athlete career.


The beautiful appearance of Liu Xuan makes her quickly remembered and also lays a foundation for her to join the entertainment circle.


After retirement, Liu Xuan starred in a number of TV series, and in 2013 she set up her own studio.


Tian Liang participated in the single and double ten-meter match of two Olympic Games, and won 2 gold and 2 silver.


But when he was defeated by his counterpart Hu Jia at the single 10-meter match in the 2004 Olympic Games, Tian Liang's competitive state slipped and it was said he was dismissed by the diving team.


But when he took along his daughter to participate in the variety show "Dad, Where Are We Going?", he became a focus.


The once gold generation Yang Wei, Li Xiaopeng and Chen Yibing all participated in a variety of variety show.


It is worth mentioning that, Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng led the Chinese team and won champion in the 2008 Olympic Games men's team. Yang Wei even got his individual all-around gold medal twice and was called as the Almighty King.


And Chen Yibing has become a ring king while leading his team to win the champion in the 2012 Olympic Games men's team.


But after he was misjudged and lost the gold in the London Olympic Games, his magnanimous act won him so many funs.


However, these game players mainly focus on the venue, they just touch and then go at the variety show.


However, no matter whether they are retired or active athletes, they need to provide outstanding performance to win in the entertainment circle.


After all, athletes have just stepped into a new area, so it is just a space state for them in case of capabilities and connection.


Even for Tian Liang and Liu Xuan, who are not new in the entertainment circle, common people always think of their performance at the Olympic Games when mentioning them.


And the introduction of Yang Wei and Li Xiaopeng at the variety show is always Olympic Games Champion.


Compared with these people, Ning Zetao is slightly weaker for the title of Swimming World Championships.


Compared with these people, the title of Ning Zetao, a swimming world championship, is not so great.


Moreover, compared with the withdrawal of Tian Liang, Liu Xuan and Yang Wei, etc. at their peaks, the withdrawal of Ning Zetao at 23 after some setback would cause immeasurable effects to the negative influence of his image.


After all, at the mention of athletes, people's requirements on athletes are "not seeking victory but for no fear of danger". Ning Zetao lags far behind from this point.


At the very least, Ning Zetao can totally rely on his great looks to win the support of thousands of huge fans.


It is a lot more difficult to be famous in the entertainment circle by just relying on good appearance than training.


You have to listen to your inner voice on your life path. But as for how to choose, Ning Zetao should be quite conscious.


On the surface, the online social platform expands our social circle and reduces people's loneliness.


The sphere of influence of social networking not only replaces the traditional telephone contact, but also gets down to the offline living circle, quietly changing the current social life of the people.


The benefits of online social network are obvious, convenient and quick, so it is particularly vulnerable to the favor of young people.


A survey of college students' social habits shows that 57% of college students spend more than 5 hours on mobile phone and is almost inseparable to his mobile phone during their daily lives.


"Social network features low cost, fast transmission speed and simultaneous communication among several people. This meets the requirement of modern college students."


Expanding the interpersonal relationship circle, more equal dialogue, avoiding social concerns are major reasons for us to be fascinated with online chat.


New comers in the company love online exchange with colleagues. "We are not familiar with each other when we just come to the company. The likes and comments on social platform makes people much closer to one another. "


People who love to make friends also love online communication. "I lost contact with my friends due to some misunderstandings. We became familiar again after a few dialogues on the group chatting."


IT engineer Wu Yan is a profound social networking lovers. His majority social life occurred online and his online contact is several times than that of offline friends.


Wu Yan himself admitted that the network is more "in his element".


"You can respond to your friends when you are willing, because there is a lot of time to think over the words and you can express it more clearly.


"The communication hidden below one's ID can avoid interpersonal clash. This not only has room for maneuver, and even gives each other more time and space to thought and deeds."


"People of different identities have the same rights and efficiency to speech. Various social concerns during real life may be eliminated immediately on internet."


However, Xiaopeng, a friend of Wu Yan, thought that Wu Yan is a "very boring otaku."


Xiaopeng and Wuyan meet each other in the group chatting. They two get familiar with each other because they are active speakers.


Xiaopeng thought that Wuyan is quite different from the one on internet. He is quite bored and does not take the initiative to express his views. His words are repeated like this, "Oh, yes, right", or "I will check it online".


Lingshui police has been involved in the investigation while Lingshui traffic sector will also intensify efforts to rectify illegal operation of vehicles.
