Last week, the broadcast of period drama “Beauty Private Kitchen” was temporarily halted, and accidentally triggered heated debate about faked ratings of locally produced dramas.


Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri


The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has put out an alert for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.


"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, effective through August 28th, 2017, calls for African American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention and exercise extreme caution when traveling throughout the state given the series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently, and noted therein," the group's statement reads.


A recent Missouri law making it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement disproportionately targeting minorities prompted the group to issue the travel alert, the NAACP said.


"You have violations of civil rights that are happening to people.


They're being pulled over because of their skin color, they're being beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told The Kansas City Star.


"We are hearing complaints at a rate we haven't heard before."


It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.


The group cited incidents such as racial slurs against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.


Sanders died under questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.


The advisory also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office showing that black drivers in the state were 75 percent more likely to be pulled over than whites.


"The advisory is for people to be aware, and warn their families and friends and co-workers of what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.


"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money with them, or letting relatives know they are traveling through the state."


Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, ranking the state at 16th in the country in terms of the number of such violations.


The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a business for housing or employment discrimination.


Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement to detain people on immigration violations which the ACLU said would increase racial profiling.


Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, advocacy groups have resorted to the measure in response to certain laws and trends inside the US.


After experiencing the “golden era” of a soaring box office in 2015, the film market retreated into a cooling-off period in 2016. Whether box office takings could surpass last year’s total of RMB44.069 billion is questionable.


Data from the National Bureau of Statistics revealed that in October, prices of new and second-hand residential properties cooled, up 0.6% and 1.1% month-on-month, respectively.


Lupekscu, the current Chief Technology Officer of UEFA, made a technical report on the 2016 UEFA Euro and the last season of European Champions League at the meeting.


BBC claims that Beijing has become the most exciting city: making foreigners feel like “living in a new age”


Reference News Network reported on January 18 that the British media organization has noticed that Beijing is rapidly transforming into a glamorous modern city in spite of the fact that it is 3000 years old.


The Chinese capital is interconnected by amazingly high-speed Internet and has implemented cutting-edge technologies such as face recognition. It has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has an unmatched capacity of internationalization. It is one of the most exciting cities for foreigners who are eager to explore the world.


According to a report on the BBC website on January 16, the German expatriate Clemens Sage said: 'If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere.' He quoted a song written by singer Frank Sinatra to praise New York City.


Sage, who served as Creative Director of Traveler Archives, said: "If Sinatra lives today, he is likely to sing a song for Beijing." He said that living in this city will make you feel like “living in a new age”, which means that you can always keep up with the trends.


Simon Norton, who originates from England had been living in Beijing in recent years, published an article on personal blog site 4Corners7Seas saying: “People generally have a feeling of being at the center of something grand. Although this feeling is hard to describe clearly, it is the reason why so many foreigners stay there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and hope to witness it. ”


According to reports, the city's high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before.


Andy Peñafuerte, who originates from Manila and is currently the deputy editor-in-chief of the website Beijing Children, said: "Beijing is rapidly transforming into a cashless society. The Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smart phones, making it easier for everyone to conduct various transactions."


According to reports, smart phones are just the beginning of Beijing's technical ambitions. Face recognition technology is being widely used across the city. Many mobile phone applications use this technology to facilitate bank transfers and payments, grant people access apartments and offices, and even use it to verify identity of the drivers providing car-hailing service.


Beijing recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park. When it is completed, more than 400 companies will settle there. They will focus on the development of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to self-driving cars.


Food plays a central role in China’s many major traditional festivals. Foreigners are enthusiastic about these festivals. The Spring Festival is the most important festival in both social and economic sense, and it is also one of the most enjoyable festivals for foreigners.


Sage said: “It's a pleasure for me to help Chinese friends prepare for the New Year. It is equally important to clean the apartment and paste the red spring couplets with blessing words on the door. On New Year’s eve, all family members must gather together to have a good meal and stay until midnight, and finally to celebrate the New Year with fireworks. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and their family is indeed an opportunity for blending. ”


According to reports, a large number of foreigners are living in Beijing and the number is growing. However, the language barrier and the convenience of exchanges between the expatriates can easily become excuses for not fully integrating into the local culture.


Sage said: 'Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have little experience with their host country. If your initial attempt to interact with the Chinese is not successful, then it is easy for you to feel more comfortable with other foreigners.


In these so-called 'foreign bubbles' ('Laowai bubble' refers to circles in which foreigners only mixed in with foreigners, without touching local people and local culture -- translator's note), foreigners mingle with each other in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and only make friends with foreigners.


The easiest way to overcome problem is to learn a little bit of Mandarin – something easier than one might think.


Sage said: “One or two hours of private lessons in Chinese every week or learning entry-level radio dramas should suit everyone’s busy schedule.”


Even learning a few classic phrases will help with shopping, ordering a meal in a restaurant, or chatting on a taxi.


According to reports, persistent air pollution is also a fact of daily life, but the government has tried to curb pollution in recent years.


Residents emphasize that outdoor activities are very important in warm months when pollution is often light. It is important to consider those blue sky days as opportunities for rambling in ancient encryptors or exploring the popular Ritan Park.


Norton said: "Beijing is a Chinese city that one can find most things below the surface. You can find very good arts and music activities, indulgent nightlife, historical wonders, ultra-modern business districts and ancient hutong areas."


The report believed that the hindrance to growth in human capital as a result of aging has become increasingly apparent. This was particularly the case in the Northeast, where the annual average contribution of aging to human capital growth was -1.28%.


Pan Gongsheng said that the present of risk of cross-border capital flows can be controlled. The fundamental factors underpinning international balance of payments will still exist over the longer term.


China News Service Beijing December 17 wire (Reporter: Gao Kai) Heritage makes the world resplendent - The opening ceremony of the 2016 International Summit for the Authentication, Restoration and Protection of Ancient Chinese Calligraphy and Painting was held at Renmin University of China on December 17.


In April this year, the European Commission accused Google of coercing mobile phone manufacturers into installing software such as the Google search engine and Chrome web browser, or they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.


The European Commission believed that this harmed consumer interests and hindered competition.


EU regulators initially requested that Google make a response prior to July 27.


If found guilty of violating antitrust rules, Google could face a maximum fine of 10% of its global turnover, or approximately US$7.4 billion.


Google has not made immediate comment on this.


Google also faced EU investigations over giving prominent placement to its own shopping services in search results.


Zhang Yuning's stay-abroad is a real one. It can be said that his achievement of “jumping level” from the national youth to the national Olympics is by no means accidental, and his leap-forward growth is still surprising.


Understand through a picture: Bitcoin's legal status around the world


Abstract: A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.


From the visualized maps, the attitude of the eastern countries towards Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West. Most countries in the world are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies, indicating that the “risk of the black swan” is still looming large.

As the authorities in major markets of Bitcoin -- such as China, South Korea and the European Union -- take decisive regulatory measures, the digital currency market dominated by Bitcoin has experienced major bloodshed this week. The price of Bitcoin has fallen below 10,000 dollar, recording the biggest one-day drop.


A part from the price correction which is natural in speculation, the current round of digital currency tumble has also to do with the 'sworn enemy'—regulation.


At this important juncture, HowMuch.net, a visualization big data website, produced a map showing the legitimacy of Bitcoin and regulation measure in place in countries around the world.


As shown in the figure below, green represents the legal market for Bitcoin, and orange represents the neutral market. Although there is no place where Bitcoin is acknowledged a legal currency, there are no major restrictions on the use it. The pale pink represents the restricted market, i.e. the local government tries to the use of the digital currency pass by drawing a red line or taking regulatory measures. The deep pink represents countries where Bitcoin is declared as illegal. The gray represents countries that have not yet been rated.


(The above figure was drawn by the HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15th)


The article points out that from the distribution of non-green color patches in the graph, it can be seen that the oriental countries in the traditional sense are more conservative towards Bitcoin than the West.


Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal. China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin. India is one of the largest countries that have not commented on Bitcoin and have not made relevant policies.


North America and Western Europe are the regions that have highest level of tolerance to Bitcoin i.e. where green patches are concentrated.


The views of the countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are clearly divided, so, the distribution of color patches in these areas is more mixed.


Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are all legitimate Bitcoin markets. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Bolivia have some restrictions on the trading and use of Bitcoin. Most Latin American countries have not made any comments about Bitcoin.


From the above data, it can be seen that of the 246 countries that have been rated, a total of 99 countries (or 40% of the total) haven't imposed any restrictions on the transactions and use of Bitcoin. They are represented by green and orange patches.


Seven countries (or 3%) are restricted markets (pale pink), 10 countries (or 4%) have defined Bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53) %) haven't given comments on digital currency (grey).


This shows that countries that account for the global majority (53%, more than half) are still indecisive about the legitimacy of digital currencies represented by Bitcoin. This means that the “black swan risk” is still very large for Bitcoin, because some of these countries may ultimately make legislation that restrict the use of digital currencies.


The article believes that global regulators have not fully understood the digital currency as a new type of currency. This may be the main reason why most countries have not chosen a stance.


Although Bitcoin’s popularity has grown exponentially since last year, it does not necessarily mean that all countries are interested in it. It's probably that some countries are concerned that the local currency may be undermined by digital currencies or that digital currencies are used by criminal organizations.


Wallstreetcn has published an article summarizing the news related to regulation measures against Bitcoin across the world since last week, including: China starts to crackdown on online platforms and mobile APPs of over-the-counter exchanges; South Korea is still considering to close the digital currency exchanges; the European Union holds the view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “losing everything”.


Wallstreetcn Editor's selection: Reading News | 2018: Global Central Banks Are Ushering Digital Currency? One article points out that 2018 is destined to be the first year of digital currency for central banks across the world, viewing from the perspectives of supervision, acceptance/criticism and adoption.


The act of questioning the legal status of Bitcoin by big countries such as Russia is actually meant to make way for the official issuance of digital currencies.


On January 8th, the Barcelona new aid Philippe Coutinho showed up for the first time in Camp Nou with his Barcelona shirt, the Xinhua News Agency reported in Madrid by reporter Xie Yuzhi.


Coutinho passed a physical examination of Barcelona early that morning and signed with Barcelona president Bartomeu a contract that will expire in the summer of 2023.


Then he appeared in the face of nearly 7,000 Camp Nou fans as a Barcelona player.


According to a Spanish media, Coutinho's transfer fee may amount to 160 million euros (1 euro≈ 1.77 Chinese yuan), being the highest paid player in the history of Barcelona and La Liga.


As Coutinho is still injured at the moment, he still need recuperate for nearly 20 days before ushering in his debut in the Barcelona shirt.

Now Trump's White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty


The surest mark of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.


Americans appreciate this as well as anyone - hence the carefully stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.


Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically limit legal immigration.


In fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.


A horde of boat-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he did.


But he did attack its meaning, and in particular the meaning ascribed to it when Emma Lazarus's famous poem was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the monument itself was completed.


As Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get off into a whole thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American liberty lighting the world.


The poem that you're referring to, that was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."


Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, this is not really about history.


It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus's startling words, the only ones in which a state has appeared to invite not just any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refuse of your teeming shore."


There has never been a time when the "wretched refuse" has been more visible on our screens.


Miller was not engaging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.


This conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is really a conflict about the meaning of America.


Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were engaging in a highly political act.


The sculpture was intended to mark the connections between French and American republicanism by representing in a well-worn classical trope, the female embodiment of Liberty.


Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.


And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of Exiles.


The marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.


And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.


The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but is rather an early neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.


She is meant to be carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.


The torch is not to light the way to the United States."


Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.


The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.


Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see it as it would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and often dreadful journeys.


It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to better their lives.


Her statue speaks back to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.


And of course, this is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.


Their torch is meant not to light the way, but to inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.

World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of Team GB


Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots made the GB team


UK Athletics' performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championships squad will make "a massive contribution to the team."


A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.


Black believes "there's something special evolving" in Scotland and UK athletics must learn from that.


"We embrace it and we're trying to understand it and we'll push on that until we work it out," Black said.


"I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they've done.


Scottish Athletics think it's something to do with what they've done.


British athletics: it's something to do with what they've done.


And the guy on the corner street, too.


Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."


Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will race against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m, while Eilidh Doyle was voted by the squad to be team captain.


"Eilidh is slightly modest.


Her captain's speech was incredible," says Black.


"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of that room feeling hugely proud and really motivated.


The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally put into it were great."


The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says it's "incredible" 16 Scots are in the British team.


Scotland's previous best total of athletes at the worlds was seven, achieved in 1983 and 2015.


Middle-distance runner Muir is leading the way, having set five British and two European records in the past year.


She will go in the 1500m and the 5,000m.


Chris O'Hare, who runs in the 1500m, is another Scot to watch, following a great season that included victory at the British Team trials and the Anniversary Games.


Doyle remembers her first world championships, when the only other Scot in the team was Lee McConnell.


The team captain says she's "hugely proud" of the fact so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but, in some cases, will be challenging for medals and competing to make finals.


"The special thing about being team captain is that it was voted for by the other members of the team, so that it was such a huge honour anyway but to know that your teammates have voted for you and chosen you made it extra-special for me," she added.


"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who've made the team.


It just shows how far we've come.


And they're here as well-established athletes, athletes that are going to be looking to get on podiums.


As for my captain's speech?


Yeah, I think it went well.


I just drew on the fact that we're very lucky in this situation in that we've got a home World Championships.


So it's really just the importance of drawing on that home support and thriving on the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.


I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such an amazing atmosphere out there."

Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, if you can't take heat from voters


The father of our country knew something about bad press.


Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for newspapers to start slamming him on everything from domestic policy to his political principles.


He chafed at the criticism, sure.


But he did not silence his critics.


Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we may be led, like sheep, to the Slaughter."


That brings me to Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.


Hogan's staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who voiced their opinions on his official Facebook page.


And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that earlier this week.


The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online commentary was rich with a "who cares?" backlash.


"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.


But it matters.


And it especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.


This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.


He has the second-highest approval rating of the nation's 50 governors.


Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.


He's shown a steady hand in leading his state and a stern adherence to principles.


He's also been pretty deft at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents, playfully debuting his hairless head after chemo treatments on his page.


So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is a public forum, labeled as official and administered by staff members paid public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.


In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.


But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.


The Post talked to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.


And they're just that - real people talking to their elected leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.


They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.


The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.


Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.


"I politely commented that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news items," she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.


"I also do not appreciate that idea that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."


What the governor's staff called a "concentrated spam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."


The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.


It's a lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.


But that's exactly what's happening, only digitally.


Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.


President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked from his Twitter feed.


One of the first landmark rulings on this issue came down last week in Virginia.


The chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page.


And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also got a visit from the ACLU over his use of Facebook and Twitter.


This shouldn't be so hard.


In Washington's time, the era of affordable postage had an impact much like the Internet.


The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hammered his leadership.


And even back then, Washington had anonymous trolls.


People using the pseudonyms "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius," and "Portius" all wrote letters to newspapers trashing Washington's decisions.


Petitions criticizing his stand on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project.


But he did not silence them.


Freedom of speech, dissent and discourse lie at the very foundation of our nation.


And true leadership means accepting that.


Any movement in the property market would have an impact on the sensibilities of the general public.


Purchase quota is a fixed threshold many cities would adopt when implementing real estate control measures.


In May 2017, Jinan issued regulations stating that undergraduates who make social security contributions consecutively for half a year will be entitled to be treated under the same residential property purchase policies as that of local residents with permanent residency.


In June, Wuhan issued policies that stipulate that university students may settle in the city within three years of graduation based on their graduation certificate and employment permit.


After the policy was enhanced, officials stated that “university students are entitled to purchase residential property at a 20% discount to market price”.


In July, Chengdu issue regulations stating that young talent with overseas university bachelor’s degree or higher academic qualifications may apply to settle in Chengdu based on their graduation certificate.


In addition, Kunshan, Lingang in Shanghai, as well as other cities or regions also issued relevant “talent introduction” policies, and lowered the threshold for buying residential property and settling locally for talents.


Zhang Hongwei believed that this was, in fact, large cities competing for population, particularly talent. Only by retaining population, particularly talent, can a city be competitive. This then, was the key significance of these real estate policies.


Some even believed that this implied that the time has come to abolish residential property “purchase quotas”.

Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club


Former European No 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comforts over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.


The Northern Irishman, who led next door at Archerfield Links heading into the final round last year before losing out to Paul Eales, is attached to the new venue and is acting as tournament ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.


"I watched Renaissance Club being built, and we're seeing it come to its glory with this event," said Rafferty.


"The players will see this course at its finest, it is in fabulous condition.


Jerry has done a fabulous job setting this place up.


He's a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here.


This is a great showcase for this course."


Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time despite winning on both the European Tour and European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.


"This does feel really special," said the Southport-based player.


"I didn't get to defend the Extremadura Open because that was taken off the schedule the year after I won it.


Coming back to this part of the world is magical.


It's a wonderful place to play golf in.


The memories from last year are coming back and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year.


It was a really special time and one we will always cherish."


Making his return to action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.


This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.


"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Helensburgh man Orr.


"You want to do well; but you do feel that extra pressure.


I've really enjoyed playing again and I've played some solid golf.


I'm happy with how it's going so far."


Joining the trio in the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.


Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scots in the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Zou Shoumin, Director of the Bureau of Environmental Supervision of the Ministry of Environmental Protection, said on the 22nd in Beijing that on a nationwide basis, 57 cases were subject to consecutive daily fines. The newly amended “Environmental Protection Law”, implemented at the beginning of this year, has significantly enhanced environmental law enforcement efforts in China.


Presently, the environmental protection bureaus across China may use various means of punishment to investigate and deal with conduct in violation of environmental regulations such as impose consecutive daily fines, close down operations and/or distrain, limit or suspend production, and persons held under administrative detention. They will also work together with judicial organs to punish environmental crimes.


Zou Shoumin said that in August, a total of 335 cases were concerned with closing close down operations and/or distrain; 177 cases pertained to limiting or suspension of production; 189 cases were concerned with persons held under administrative detention; and 166 cases pertained to persons held under suspicion of environmental pollution crimes.


In particular, Henan imposed consecutive daily fines on seven cases. At present, China is moving from control at the end toward being involved throughout the entire process, intensifying efforts to treat environmental pollution on an all-round basis.


Although pressures from slower economic growth have emerged, China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection had already made its position clear; China should correctly and appropriately position environmental protection in economic growth, and increase “green determination”. The more economic growth decelerates, the more it should hold fast to environmental protection, and ensure that environmental protection plays a positive role in optimizing the economy.

2017 year-to-date, the share prices of most listed baijiu companies have continued to soar. In particular, the share prices of Swellfun, Wuliangye Yibin, Shanxi Xinghuacun Fen Wine, and Kweichow Maotai have at least doubled

At the same time as the daily monitoring,

The Institute of Ecology and the Environment, Tsinghua Yangtze River Delta Research Institute in Zhejiang Province is located in Jiaxing, the birthplace of the Red Boat spirit.

The spirit of the Red Boat is a force that we must follow and understand. Innovation is actually very difficult.


There is a lot of frustration behind all innovations in this area,


none of them can be solved. At this stage, you have to stick to it and keep going.


Previously, ordinary people asked for help, but now, officials have come to help. That is


to do real things for the people.


Up to now, in this way, Xiaoshan District collected a total of 5,985 issues, of which 3,868 were solved and 1,496 were in the process of being handled.

They went deeply into the grassroots mass art museums, local academies and some colleges and universities in Inner Mongolia, as well as Heilongjiang and Gansu provinces to conduct a profound interpretation of the new cultural mission


I am deeply proud and happy, and I am willing to go down and write more about the fate of the normal people in the major times.


on the development of grassroots literature and art.


Nowadays mass literature and art are very popular, there is a little popularity,


and continue to launch quality works worthy of the times.


It should be rooted at grassroots and in-depth lives, with a certain substance of culture that is positive, with long-lasting artistic works that hold charm.

conducted four scans of an area all-day in the past two years during orbit and detected more than 3.5 billion high-energy particles. It obtained the most accurate


This achievement has recently been published in Nature, an international academic journal.


In space, we observe that such a new observation that has not been observed before, which cannot be explained or illustrated by existing theories,


The significance of this result is diverse. Above all, it shows the ability of Chinese scientists to use the most cutting-edge technologies


to make scientific instruments to probe a very difficult scientific issue.


Find the toilet by the nose, in the last century, this is memory that many Chinese are fond of.


but also incorporates more humanized designs.


impressed so many tourists. The toilet has ventilation all year around without a peculiar smell.


We no longer need to rely on the nose to find the toilet.


We should not only change the hardware, but the software must also keep up.


The tourism department requires that toilets at famous sites should be equipped with toilet paper and hand sanitizer.


But in some areas,


Whether to stop this convenient service or not due to the uncivilized behavior of individuals


Was decided by managers from all areas who have made their choice.


On the one hand, through civilized prompts to promote conservation, on the other hand, they also carry out technological innovation.


In public toilets in places like Nanjing and Sucheng in Jiangsu Province,


by scanning your face for three seconds, you can get a free copy of the toilet paper, but if you want to get double copies, you need to wait ten minutes.


This avoids the abuse of public resources.


habits. Some tourists may indeed think of taking the paper back, but on the other hand, we must reflect on this situation.


Is there paper in the next toilet for tourists to use? This is what we highlighted in the new three-year plan.


To solve this problem of inadequacy and imbalance


and to push the revolution in toilets further, we should think more of what the masses think.


to have a third toilet to facilitate family members to accompany the elderly and children to the restroom.


We take our baby to the men’s room and we are embarrassed,


but when w go to the ladies’ room, babies are so small that we also feel a bit embarrassed. That board is particularly comfortable, it is convenient for those who have children.


people feel more civilized and have become civilized builders. In the villages, villagers in Hechi, Guangxi, are creating flushing toilets in their homes,


Great achievements have been made and the active promotion of the toilet revolution does not only help people stay away from disease, but also promotes economic development to narrow the regional development gap.


This toilet problem is an issue of expository themes, it is a node of the social development.


It is a national civilized project that leads from the national point of view to the layout, and then takes part in all aspects to solve the small social problems with varying degrees of participation.


In this way, we can make up for all shortcomings.


With the recent commencement of construction of Jinxi Irrigation District in Heilongjiang Province, this year began with a major water conservancy project across the country and has reached 14 items.

Next up, a look at international news.


On the 2nd, after voting, the US Senate has passed a massive tax cut bill.


Analysts say it marks the Trump administration and Republican congressional parliament a step closer to completing the nation's largest tax relief program in three decades.


The Republican-majority Senate ultimately passed the tax cut as a result of 51 votes in favor and 49 against it.


and for the middle class.


Democrats, on the other hand, have criticized the bill as benefiting large corporations and the rich in the United States.


On the 2nd, U.S. President Trump welcomed the Senate voting to pass the tax cut bill


and stressed that all economic measures by the government are boosting the U.S. economy.


At the same time, Trump also criticized that it is a mistake for Democratic members of the Senate


to vote against the bill.


According to the U.S. legislative process, the two chambers will still reach a final unified version of the tax reduction bill in the coming weeks.


And then voted separately before


According to a spokesman for the Yemeni Houthis armed forces and former President Saleh, the fighting between the two sides on the 2nd in the capital, Sana, has become more severe. Now, it has resulted in the death of 80 people.


Over 100 people were wounded. According to witnesses, both parties in the conflict dispatched heavy weapons such as tanks and started fighting on the streets of Sana, leaving thousands of people, including children, trapped in the central part of Sana.


Currently, the Republican Guard supporting Saleh is also occupying the airport.


The presidential palace and some important government agencies announced the imposition of a curfew in the occupied territories.


The Houthis armed forces claimed to have taken control of today's television station, which belonged to Saleh.


Houthis armed forces and Saleh formed an alliance in late 2014 to fight the legitimate government led by Yemeni President Hady.


In September this year, the Houthis Armed Forces announced the appointment of military commanders and other senior positions.


Saleh refused to recognize the appointment.


In late November, sporadic fighting started between Saleh supporters and the Houthis Armed Forces.


At the same time, former Yemeni President Saleh said that


he was ready to open a new chapter of relations with the multinational coalition led by Saudi Arabia and begin to work with the coalition forces in a positive way


However, the premise is that the multinational coalition should stop the attack on Yemen first.


In response, the multinational coalition headed by Saudi Arabia issued a statement that


On the 2nd, U.S. President Trump said his campaign team has absolutely no collusion with Russia.


This is Trump’s first response to the Russian investigation after Flynn, the former


Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, admitted perjury.


Trump also said he is not worried about what Flynn will say to investigators.


On the 1st, Flynn admitted to the judge that he had committed perjury with the FBI on personal contact with Russia and


He has repeatedly expressed his opposition to the German government’s acceptance of immigrants and even stated through right-wing rhetoric that Germany should be proud of veterans in World War II.


A large number of local people gathered outside the venue of the conference to protest. They strongly opposed the far-right populism advocated by the party.


In September this year, during the German federal election, the Select Party was elected to become the third largest party in the House.


This is the first time that Germany had a far-right political party entering the federation after World War II.

In support of Saleh’s armed forces.


Next, please watch the details.


Our news. At the invitation of President Xi Jinping, the President of the Republic of Maldives Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom will have a state visit to China


from December 6 to September 9.


This important exposition has given us loud trumpets to fulfill the new mission and proceed on a new journey.


Starting from today, Xinwen Lianbo will launch a series of reports entitled New Era, New Atmosphere, and New Act.


This is the first company in the world to develop and manufacture educational robots. After graduating from university, 23-year-old Xiao Xu


chose to come to Shanghai and he built his own team within half a year.


My dream is to make a robot that belongs to myself and helps others.


The robot needs some motors, steering gears, and controllers, all of which can now be developed ourselves.


Shanghai introduced preferential policies


It also led a group of innovative talents to stay in the country and stay in Shanghai.


The 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China first proposed the construction of a modern economic system and demanded that


are being transformed from traditional manufacturing industries.


In the first three quarters of this year, the value of smart manufacturing reached nearly 16 billion yuan, an increase of nearly 40% over the same period last year. Our original business was


producing the elevator control system. In the past few years, we clearly felt that the new kinetic energy of the whole new industry was not enough. Therefore, we


stepped up the transformation and development of this enterprise.


In accordance with General Secretary Xi Jinping’s request, Shanghai is speeding up its march toward becoming a science and technology innovation center with global influence.


In order to speed up the process of transforming of scientific research from paper to money, Shanghai promulgated local regulations this year to promote the transformation and service of scientific and technological achievements.


Ten days after the closing ceremony of the 19th NPC, Shanghai released to the public the implementation opinions on further promoting the development of a new generation of artificial intelligence.


In the process of innovation, there are many unsuitable conditions.


can thrive with vitality.


Enter a new era, science and technology innovation are promising.


Located in Shanghai, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Micro-Satellite Innovation is the vanguard of China's satellite technology innovation research.


to make a certain thing. In itself, the target choice for this task is new.


With the average age of researchers being only 31 years old, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Micro-Satellite Innovation


will also launch five satellites in the near future.


From materials and devices to components of all-round innovation, it promotes the upgrade and transformation of China's manufacturing industry chain.


In the report of the 19th NPC, it is clearly stated that China has entered into a new era. Personally, the standard of a powerful nation is to take the lead.


So far, all satellites launched by our Little Satellite Institute have been groundbreaking, and we will not follow others or chase after others.


which comprehensively enhance Shanghai's original innovation capability and out-pace the strategic competence of the world in science and technology innovation and development.


Entering into a new era, the strong driving force brought by innovation-driven development to Shanghai is emerging.


Braving to try, daring to make breakthrough, self-determination and the enterprising spirit also originate from the fact that Shanghai has always taken institutional reform as the key to developing this great article.


The report of the 19th National Congress of the CPC pointed out that to deepen the reform of the science and technology system and establish an innovation system that takes the enterprise as the main body, the market as the orientation and the industry-university-research institute must have deep integration,


which is precisely for the reform mechanism to promote innovation and create a better atmosphere for the innovation subject.


After the welcoming ceremony, Li Keqiang held the second annual dialog between China and Canada with Trudeau.


Li Keqiang made positive comments on the development of Sino-Canadian relations over the past year


Li Keqiang said that at present, economic globalization continues to advance. A new round of scientific and technological industrial revolution has swept the globe.


To maintain the sound and stable development of Sino-Canadian relations, we must comply with the trend of the times,


uphold mutual respect, treat each other equally, seek mutual benefits and win-win cooperation, and constantly expand common interests.


Li Keqiang pointed out that Sino-Canadian pragmatic cooperation has strong complementarity and it is expected to expand bilateral trade and investment, encourage the enterprises of the two countries to invest and start business in each other's countries,


Li Keqiang stressed that both China and Canada are important countries in the Asia-Pacific region and significant trade nations in the world, and the positive signals sent by both countries on promoting the liberalization of trade and investment is in the common interests of both sides.


The door to China's opening up to the outside world will become larger and larger and the business environment will become better and better. China will continue to be a hot spot for international investment.


in the spirit of mutual benefit and reciprocity.


Canada supports free trade and is ready to work with China to promote globalization and free trade and make its contribution to the sustainable development of the world.


Both sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues of common interest.


After the talks, China's premier and the prime minister of Canada witnessed the signing of bilateral cooperation documents in the fields of education, food safety, and energy.


On the afternoon of the 4th, Li Keqiang and Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau jointly met with reporters.


Li Keqiang introduced the outcome of the second annual ministerial-level dialog between China and Canada.


He said both China and Canada unanimously agree to promote the process of globalization and safeguard the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment,and both are ready to work together to explore the feasibility of the FTA.


China is open to the process and the content of the negotiation.


Both sides agree to step up cooperation in tourism and aviation and to closely promote humanities exchanges between the two countries.


We share opportunities and welcome challenges together to push forward the Sino-Canadian relations in this golden stage.


deepen cooperation in various fields, commit to common development and prosperity, and build a stable and active relationship with China in the medium to long term.


Zhang Dejiang, president of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attended the 4th National Constitution Day Symposium and delivered a speech on the 4th.


He emphasized that we need to regard the study and implementation of the socialist ideology with Chinese characteristics in a new era of Xi Jinping


as the most important task in studying and implementing the spirit of the 19th CPC National Congress. It is important to comprehensively implement the major decision making and deployment on strengthening the implementation and supervision of the constitution under the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core.


We must unswervingly adhere to the principles of the Constitution, carry forward the spirit of the Constitution, fulfill the mission of the Constitution, and give full play to the important role of the Constitution in successfully building a well-off society in an all-around way


and build an all-around modernized socialist nation.


Zhang Dejiang pointed out that the Constitution is the fundamental law of the country and is the general charter for administering state affairs well and ensuring national security.


It is the concentrated expression of the will of the party and the people. To vigorously carry forward the spirit of the Constitution and fully implement the Constitution, we must unswervingly adhere to the leadership of the CPC,


firmly maintain the central position of General Secretary Xi Jinping, firmly safeguard the authority of the Party Central Committee and centralize and unify the leadership, unswervingly uphold socialism with Chinese characteristics,


and equality before the law.


Zhang Dejiang emphasized that conducting in-depth publicity and education on the Constitution is important fundamental work for comprehensively promoting the administration of the country according to the law and is also a long-term task that needs constant effort.


We should continue to play the important role of performing the activities on National Constitution Day and pledge allegiance to the Constitution, carry out publicity and education on the Constitution by using the methods loved by the masses,


strive to improve law attainment by the entire nation, and lay a solid ideological foundation and create a good social environment for pushing forward the implementation of Constitutional law.


to establish constitutional awareness and enhance their confidence in the Constitution. They will become firm believers, preachers, practitioners, and defenders of the Constitution.


Li Jianguo attended the symposium.


Wang Chen presided over the symposium.


Vice Premier Wang Yang of the State Council will attend the opening ceremony of the 2017 Fortune Global Forum held in Guangzhou from December 6 to December 8


and deliver a keynote speech.


Meanwhile, Vice Premier Wang Yang will meet with Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau and the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea O'Neill who will attend the forum.


The symposium on carrying forward the Red Ship Spirit was held on December 4 in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province. Wang Huning, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, attended the meeting and made a speech.


We will promote the further study and implementation of the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Party and Xi Jinping's thoughts on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, inspire and encourage all cadres and masses


to promote great practice with great spirit, never forget their initial mission, keep their mission firmly in mind, and make unremitting efforts to achieve the tasks put forward by the 19th National Congress.


Wang Huning said that the spirit of the Red Ship is the source of the Chinese revolutionary spirit, and it shows the initial intention of the Chinese Communists.


The pioneering spirit


and the spirit of struggle and dedication it carries are the spiritual impetus to our party's tenacious struggle and continuous development and growth. It is also a valuable spiritual asset for our party to establish and govern and rejuvenate the country.


It is also a strong spiritual support to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.


We must integrate the idea of carrying forward the spirit of the Red Ship and deepening the study and publicity of the 19th National Congress and firmly grasp the main idea of Xi Jinping's thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.


Make great efforts on learning and mastering.


We should deepen the study and publicity of the revolutionary spirit, such as the spirit of the Red Ship, and carry out various forms of educational practice to guide people in actively participating in the great practice of socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era.


Before the forum, the participants jointly paid tribute to the Red Ship in South Lake.


And they visited the South Lake Revolutionary Memorial Hall.


The General Office of the Central Military Commission recently printed and issued the Notice on Carefully Organizing and Learning Xi Jinping's Speech on the Governance of China, Volume II.


It demands that the PLA and the Armed Police Force thoroughly study and understand Xi Jinping's socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era and raise the spirit of learning, propaganda, and implementation of the 19th National Congress.


The Notice points out that studying and implementing Xi Jinping's socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era is a major political task of the entire party and army for the present and future.


At all levels, we should have the highest political consciousness and the highest standards and take on the first


and second volume of Xi Jinping: The Governance of China, published previously as the authoritative books in the profound study and understanding of Xi Jinping's socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era, and the spirit of the 19th National Congress,


and unify it to the major decisions and deployments set by the 19th National Congress of the party.


Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Land of Gold


When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.


She rarely even uses a pot.


In her wooden home in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai regency in the restive Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually just places a sweet potato - known locally as "nota" - directly into the fireplace.


After half-an-hour, the charred tuber is retrieved and devoured with eager, unwashed hands.


Degei sits on the mud floor - she has no furniture - which is where she also performs her daily chores, such as washing clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp.


A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.


As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she has been assigned no fields to tend.


Polygamy is common here.


Of course, working late can be dangerous: Most of the village men are unemployed and many drink heavily, plus there are the soldiers.


"No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.


It's a rare glimpse of daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was absorbed into Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when just 1,026 elders were forced to vote through a public show of hands before occupying troops.


An existing movement agitating for independence against Dutch rule swiftly turned its ire against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, barring foreign journalists or rights monitors.


In 2003, the province was officially split into Papua and West Papua, with independent Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.


Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate; the journey here involves a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire, and then a stomach-churning five-hour drive by hire car.


There is no public transport.


The town of some 19,000 people consists of wooden houses ringed by bamboo fencing, corrugated iron roofs transformed by rust into varying tawny shades.


Very few Indonesians have made the journey here, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.


Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.


There were other changes, too.


"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, indicating her vividly colored, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and a bright skirt.


"Before, we only wore leaves on our bodies."


Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and with some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.


But it is also Indonesia's land of gold.


The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, lies just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province around the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.


In 2015 alone, Freeport mined some $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.


In addition, Papua boasts timber resources worth an estimated $78 billion.


These riches are, however, a source of misery for Papuans, ensuring Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.


A 2005 investigation in The New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.


Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose, and are dealt with mercilessly.


According to rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.


Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.


Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region last year alone.


We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, contains testimony of atrocities committed the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - rape and electrocution are especially popular, according to another report - and the brutal crushing of peaceful demonstrations.


"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.


The screws have tightened as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.


The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but the demographic is changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.


Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado mixed-vegetables served with peanut sauce.


Local people struggle to compete.


"The migrants started to sell chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuans," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.


"It made the native Papuans - the mama-mama [the women] of Papua - lose their market."


Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address the inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his election campaign in 2014.


The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total 29 districts - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.


But precious little has changed in Papua, and today local people feel betrayed.


"Our hearts have been broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, with the expectation that he would fulfill our hopes for justice to be restored," You says.


In fact, Paniai suffered a nadir just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration.


On Dec. 7, 2014 a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorbike broke through the gloom.


The startled children told them that they should turn on their headlights.


One of the soldiers took umbrage at their tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.


The soldiers, who had been drinking, chased and beat the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.


Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.


One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly he fell into a coma.


A couple of hours later, the nearby government Election Commission building was set ablaze, and things escalated the following day.


About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.


They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the waita dance - running in circles and simulating birdsong - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.


Some protesters started hurling stones at police and military posts.


As tempers grew more heated, an order was sent to the soldiers through internal radio: "If the masses offer resistance more than three times, shoot them dead," it said, according to an official document seen by TIME that has not been released to the local media.


Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarotali, saw the impending danger and appealed for calm, imploring the crowd to go back home.


Nobody was in the mood to listen.


"When I turned around I suddenly got shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.


Kayame still doesn't know who fired but says the bullet came from the ranks of amassed soldiers.


"It was crowded, many shots were fired," he adds.


Local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shootings.


"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who like many Indonesians only goes by one name, told TIME somberly.


"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."


The Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "securing" their station because it was under attack.


"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesperson, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.


"It's a matter of life and death."


According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.


News of the killings only filtered through to Jakarta the following day.


Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, where he expressed sympathies with the victims' families and vowed to address the historic abuses in Papua.


"I want this case to be solved immediately so it won't ever happen again in the future," he said.


Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up a non-judicial mechanism to settle historic human-rights violations.


But the excuses started almost immediately.


"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.


Some were in the '90s and in early 2000s.


The point is we are committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes to go through," he said.


Then Wiranto backtracked when speaking to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he has no plans to establish a grievance mechanism in Papua.


Instead, "All will be settled by law," he said.


Wiranto, who the U.N. has indicted for "crimes against humanity" relating to more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said that 11 cases of human-rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident.


Families of the Paniai victims greeted such claims with grim incredulity.


"I've been interviewed four times for the past three years, but there has been no progress at all," Yohanes says.


"I'm tired."


He says that years later, he still lives in fear.


"I'm afraid," he says.


"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid to be shot."


His brother Yacobus echoed the view that people in Paniai are fearful of discussing the incident.


He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.


"After burying the bodies, the military came looking for me," he says.


The shootings haven't stopped.


On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighboring Deiyai regency.


One person died and 17 others were wounded, including children, during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help transport an unconscious man to hospital.


The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw who drowned while he was fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.


Incensed villagers protested in front of the company's site office.


Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers, who responded by firing warning shots.


But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.


"We were so panicked, we are afraid there will be revenge," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured being hurried in, tells TIME.


"I have been hiding in my house for two days."


The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.


Paniai has always been a troublespot for the Indonesian government.


The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the tribal Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal peoples, who live sprawled across Papua's verdant central highlands.


Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuans by launching sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.


Some of the top OPM leaders hail from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.


In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in recent years, under the guise of "safeguarding national sovereignty."


Some never reappear.


Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."


Poverty feeds the discontent.


The little rice on sale in Enarotali is too expensive for locals to buy.


Bread is just as out of reach.


People here grow everything they eat: mainly nota plus some fruit and leafy vegetables.


Farming is the job of the women, who each can maintain four or five fields of the sweet potato.


They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, with the rest sold in the local market.


Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupiah (75 cents).


Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of a new air routes to Nabire Airport.


What few jobs exist typically go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.


Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.


"The young people are not interested to stay in the village ... because there's no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai.


Isolation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.


In addition, reporting restrictions for international media remain tight.


Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for a "lack of coordination with related institutions" despite having been granted rare permission to film.


According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, Jokowi's election campaign pledges to lift reporting restrictions to boost transparency and development have not been realized.


"There are new hazards for foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia's restive easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
