The lack of press scrutiny means international pressure on the Indonesian government has been largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbors.


In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and the Solomon Islands - urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.


These same countries have historically backed the OPM.


Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Arrmanatha Nasir shrugged off the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta, "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies and there's free media so it's hard for the evidence of human rights cases to be covered up."


Local people want more foreign governments to take note.


When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the nation's human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people broke their silence, beseeching, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but who asked to stay anonymous.


Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi.


"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the tribal council chairman.


He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, aside from living under the looming threat of a rapacious military, wallow in destitution, with paltry education and health services.


Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, consider their vote to Jokowi as a "debt" he must repay.


"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.


Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: burying one victim's body on land just opposite the police and military station.


Knowing that justice may never be served, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.


"A member of our family has been killed," says Yacobus, head bowed.


"What else could we do?"


Brands such as Suofeiya, Holike and Topstrong have leveraged the strength of capital to actively grow their business in the customized home furnishing industry. On February 10, 2017, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) approved the IPO application of Guangzhou Shangpin Home Collection Co., Ltd., and issued a listing permit on the Small and Medium Enterprise Board of Shenzhen Stock Exchange. More than 20 days ago, Oppein Home Group received approval for its IPO.


Industry insiders believed that with the listings of Shangpin Home Collection and Oppein Home Group, the customized home furnishing sector, which was already soaring, will turn from production competition to competing for capital.


At the beginning of the new year, when Shangpin Home Collection’s IPO was first approved, news of the listing of this classic brand, which represented the customized home furnishing sector, attracted the attention of the entire home furnishing industry.


On the 9th (Beijing time), Reuters reported that Samsung Electronics Co Ltd launched its first set of components for autonomous driving and infotainment solutions it jointly developed with Harman International on Tuesday. This was a major move by the company to expand into the automotive electronics market.


Samsung Electronics acquired Harman International about a year ago.


At the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas this week, Samsung unveiled its automotive camera equipped with collision warning, lane-departure warning, and adaptive cruise control, which was also developed jointly with Harman.


Samsung plans to begin shipping this camera system, which is built on automatic machine learning and augmented reality technology this year.


Samsung also exhibited a “digital cockpit”, which allows a car to adapt to the personalized characteristics of the driver even if he or she is not the car owner by accessing the user’s information from mobile devices and cloud.

Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for second time


A fire ripped through one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of occupants to flee the 337 metre-tall, 79-storey structure.


It's the second blaze to sweep through the high-rise - which happens to be called the Torch tower - in just two years.


The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no immediate word on the cause of the blaze.


"We were sleeping and we woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.


We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to reach from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.


Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting squads put out the blaze at around 4.00 am local time (0000 GMT) and were cooling the building.


The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected.


The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used on the exteriors of tall buildings across the world.


An investigation by the management of the Torch after its 2015 fire found that most of the damage was to the cladding, exterior panelling used for decoration or insulation.


In the UK, police have said they believe the system of insulation and cladding panels on London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire there in June in which some 80 people died.


The Williams team also suggested that Massa might return, even though he had already announced his retirement.


January 9 is just a month away from the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. As the Olympic torch relay moves north, warm-ups and intense preparations for the Games were carried out. South Korea was warming up for the Winter Olympics.


Public opinion in South Korea hope that this long-waited North-South Dialog would lead to an “Easter egg” (nice surprise) for the countdown to the PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.


The Winter Olympic torch arrived in South Korea on November 1 last year.


The fervor stirred up by the Olympic torch is directly reflected on the sale of admission tickets for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics.


A little over two months ago, the proportion of tickets sold lingered at 32% for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics, and a mere 4.3% for the Winter Paralympics. The sluggish ticket sales caused concern among the outside world about the popularity of the PyeongChang Winter Olympics at one point.


However, just as the Chairman of the PyeongChang Organizing Committee for the 2018 Olympic & Paralympic Winter Games, Lee Hee-Beom predicted, “As the Winter Olympic torch is carried and passed on across South Korea, interest in the Winter Olympics will rise. I believe that ticket sales will turn around very quickly”.


South Korean media reported that as of January 3, the proportion of tickets sold for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics has reached 64%, and that for the Paralympics has also exceeded 50%.


To encourage foreigners to come to watch the Games, South Korea’s Ministry of Justice has also announced on the 8th that foreigners who visit the country for the PyeongChang Winter Olympics may extend their stay for up to 120 days.


More than 1 in 5 US travellers carry prohibited items onto aircraft, survey finds


A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 per cent had knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past the US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints onto the aircraft, including at least 6 per cent who boarded the plane while unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.


Less than 1 per cent claimed that they discovered belatedly that they had mistakenly travelled with firearms, ammunition or explosives.


The survey of more than 1000 people - which was conducted by a jet-chartering service Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travellers were more likely to flout the rules.


Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 per cent were millennials, compared with less than 15 per cent who were members of Generation X.


The most common items whisked past TSA agents on purpose were food and liquids.


More than 3 per cent admitted knowingly carrying bladed items past security, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents also acknowledged intentionally carrying prohibited drugs onto the aircraft.


The company said it surveyed travellers around the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done so on purpose.


It's no surprise that the people most likely to haul contraband past security - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly the most.


As the company points out, however, the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.


People are often uncertain of what liquids they can carry or how much of them.


So it's no surprise that the largest amount of stuff seized by the TSA happens to be forbidden liquids.


For a time, people thought the TSA might be treating books as contraband.


Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.


EPA Chief Pruitt Backtracks on Delaying Obama-Era Rules to Reduce Emissions


One day after getting sued by 15 states, Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay implementation of Obama-era rules reducing emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.


Pruitt presented the change as his agency being more responsive than past administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.


He made no mention of the legal challenge filed against his prior position in a federal appeals court.


At issue is an Oct. 1 deadline for states to begin meeting 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.


Pruitt announced in June he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth."


Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's state attorney general prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.


Since arriving in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations opposed by the chemical and fossil-fuel industries.


Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.


Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled the EPA administrator overstepped his authority in trying to delay implementation of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.


In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested his about-face on ozone standards simply reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through the complex process of meeting the new standards on time.


"Under previous administrations, EPA would often fail to meet designation deadlines, and then wait to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing in a settlement to set schedules for designation," said Pruitt, who sued EPA more than a dozen times in his prior job.


"We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.


We also take the statute and the authority it gives us seriously."


Still, the EPA's statement said Pruitt may at some point once again use his "delay authority and all other authority legally available" to ensure regulations "are founded on sound policy and the best available information."


Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozone rules.


A House bill approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules at least eight years.


The measure has not yet been brought to a vote in the Senate.


New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to keep up the legal pressure.


"The EPA's reversal - following our lawsuits - is an important win for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers, and the over 115 million Americans directly impacted by smog pouring into their communities," Schneiderman said.


New York was joined in the case by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.


Ground-level ozone is created when common pollutants emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight.


The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems among sensitive groups of people, contributing to thousands of premature deaths each year.


Public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Pruitt's surprising change of course.


"It's disturbing how much pressure it took to get this commonsense step from the guy in charge of protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.


"We've got to keep fighting the Trump administration's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and special interests."

Since the second half of 2009, sales (volume) of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have remained relatively buoyant. This Spring in particular, sales of Xiaoshan’s seedlings recorded a historic high. Sales volume grew significantly and prices jumped. Statistics revealed that for the first six months of the year, the sales revenue of seedlings in the Xiaoshan District increased by 48% year-on-year, and the magnitude of the growth rate was the biggest in nearly 20 years.


Shi Haiyong, Deputy Director of the Xiaoshan Forestry Bureau, said that the production of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs also grown rapidly along with the positive sales trend.


In the last two years, the planting acreage of Xiaoshan’s flowering trees and shrubs have expanded by 30,000 mu, with total area at 180,000 mu. At the same time, expansion is being actively carried out outside the region. Xiaoshan’s farmers have been setting up flowering tree and shrub bases totaling 80,000 mu across the country, an increase of 30,000 mu from that in 2008.


While expanding planting acreage, the quality of the seedlings have also continued to improve; the existing value of the nurseries has been rising. More large specimen and high quality seedlings have been preserved, and sellers have been reluctant to sell some seedlings.


Shi Haiyong also said that confronted with the current buoyant peak production and sales period, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze the situation, and take into consideration that the demand for flowering trees and shrubs is long term and will continue to increase. At the same time, they should also be aware that market competition will intensify.


July 13 morning Beijing Time. US-based Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas accusing Apple of infringing on a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.


The company had previously used the same patent to sue Asus, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.


The lawsuit claimed that iPhone 6s and Apple equipment similar to it have violated US Patent No. 7,657,386, which is known as “Integrated battery service system”.


The plaintiff is seeking monetary damages or royalties on the infringing equipment upon announcement of the verdict.


According to the indictment, the plaintiff appears to believe that iPhone’s fast-charging technology jas violated the former’s patent.


iPhone’s fast-charging function charges the battery quickly until to 80% of its capacity, then switches to slower trickle charging.


Somaltus is actually a so-called “patent troll” because the company does not provide any apparent product or service, and it is hard to find any information on the company online.


However, it has successfully reached out-of-court settlement with auto makers such as Ford and Nissan with this patent.


The meeting believed that accelerating information development; promoting interconnection and integration, as well as efficient utilization of resources; and enhancing the level of digitization and intelligence in industry would have great significance for advancing “Made in China 2025”; entrepreneurship and innovation by the masses; developing new drivers; and raising the standard of living for the masses.

Trump pressured Mexico on border wall payment according to leaked phone call transcripts


Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been leaked by the Washington Post.


On 27th January in a phone call to Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a proposed border wall.


The US President berated him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him "You cannot say that to the press."


Trump launched his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the US southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.


Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published revealing a tense exchange.


Mr Trump told Mr Turnbull a deal for the US to take on refugees headed for Australia was "ridiculous," "rotten" and "stupid," insisting the deal, brokered under the Obama administration, would make him look like "a dope" after he had proposed a ban on refugee resettlement in the US.


Mr Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull "this is the most unpleasant call all day."

Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Reenact Racist Lynching as a Call for Justice


A 1948 Ford Mercury passed through a group of onlookers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled toward the small Moore's Ford Bridge.


Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns stepped forward to block its path.


The leader of the mob - a middle aged man in a pinstriped suit - took a long drag on his cigar and peered through the windshield.


Inside, the occupants reeled in fear.


"We want that n----r Roger!" the man barked.


"Get him out of the car!"


Screams ripped through the silence as a young black man was dragged from the front passenger seat.


Fortunately, this horrific scene, which played out on July 22, is just a reenactment.


But when a noose is thrown around the neck of "Roger," nearly everyone in the audience let out very real gasps.


Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to recreate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.


No one has ever been charged with the murders.


"It's mind boggling that all of these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.


"It's a stain on a history, but it's a burden on our souls."


Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.


For him, the reenactment serves as a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.


"We want prosecution, we want closure, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but we have to have justice first," he said.


"We can't get to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."


A coroner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore's Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.


According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching.


But not one was ever prosecuted.


Though the suspects have remained at large for decades, civil rights activists say the twin motivations for the lynchings were always well known throughout town: politics and sex.


In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens in Georgia to cast ballots for the first time during the primary race later that summer.


Around the same time of the election, according to the FBI, black sharecropper Roger Malcom stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, during a fight - ostensibly over a woman.


Brooks said the town rumor was that Hester had been sleeping with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not her husband's.


On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to bail Malcom out of jail, according to the FBI.


He was accompanied to the prison by Dorothy, and their cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.


But, driving away from the jail, as they approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.


"As it turns out it was Harrison who set up and ordered the murders," one FBI report concludes.


"It is also apparent that there was a conspiracy among state and local law enforcement, who not only took part in the murders, disposed of evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."


Brooks put it more succinctly.


"It was a voting rights massacre," he said.


"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: 'If you register and if you vote, this is what will happen to you.'"


For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has directed the annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge lynchings.


Her performance is graphic, gripping and grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.


It's difficult to watch, and even more difficult to look away, but Greene said that's the point.


"We don't want to talk about the lynching because it makes us face the ugliness in all of us," she said.


"But I can't build a relationship with you, if you won't hear me, or hear what I've been through."


Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched into a well-rehearsed overview of the play.


Wade Marbaugh serves as Greene's co-director.


He's played the part of the head Klansman for years, but he said the role never gets any easier.


"I feel dirty because this is not who I am," said Marbaugh.


"But I think it's very important to keep this history alive because we don't want to go back to those times."


Across the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.


The play begins with Malcom shouting and shoving Hester, livid that he's been sleeping with his wife, Dorothy.


"I said n---a, get off my property!"


Rascona fires back.


There's a beat.


And then everyone (at least all the black actors) bursts into laughter.


Greene laughs the hardest.


"What?!," Rascona asked.


He's alarmed, confused.


Did I go too hard?


"No," Greene said through chuckles.


"I just don't think white people back then said 'n---a.'"


"Yea," one of the other black cast members quipped.


"You have to hit the hard 'R.'"


And just like that the energy in the room shifts; a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.


Everyone is dedicated to getting this right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.


The scene begins again.


This time, when Rascona says the N-word, it's sharp and emphatic.


Absolutely no one laughs.


The reenactment ends violently and quickly.


There's screams, gunfire and then, silence.


A woman dressed in funeral black, stands over the actors bodies and performs Billie Holiday's mournful eulogy, "Strange Fruit."


Her voice breaks on every other word.


A hundred yards back, a group of about four dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears away from their eyes.


The audience is almost evenly split between black and white.


One couple has traveled from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many are from just down the road.


They've all weathered Georgia's oppressive humidity for the nearly eight hours as Brooks lead them on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Malcoms and Dorseys.


Up until this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynchings took place, the air feels haunted.


As the final notes of the song fade, Greene invites the crowd to move closer and inspect the bodies.


Children crouch by their heads, take in the fake blood and still bodies, and whisper to each other.


"They're not really dead," one little boy mutters, as if to remind himself.


After a few minutes Greene thanks the crowd, and suddenly it's over.


The actors throw off the lynching rope and wipe away tears.


Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the head Klansman.


Nick Rascona hugs two of his castmates, and then breaks down crying in their arms; the emotional toll of the performance finally getting to him.


"It's okay," one of the women whispers.


"We know that's not what's in your heart.


You did this for a reason."


Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.


At one table, a white couple from Atlanta chats animatedly about the reenactment with a black couple they just met.


Denise Duplinski struggled to find words for how the performance made her feel.


"It's hard to hear those horrible awful words, and deeds ... come out of people that look like you and who do it because they look like you," she said.


"What this really does to me is make me think that lynchings are still going on," she added, "they're just called police shootings now."


Across the room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, eating and reminiscing about civil rights.


He said he's already begun planning for next year's performance.


"The reenactment is inspirational in a way because it describes the horror of what we endured, but it also is a teaching moment," he said.


"It's like, if you don't learn from this, it can happen again.


Those who don't study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it."


As regards implementing market-oriented reforms associated with natural gas, the importance of reform with respect to “pipeline and grid independence” is self-evident, but more resistance and controversy can be expected.


On the 7th, reporters learned from Kailuan (Group) that at 11:25 am on the 7th, an explosion occurred at the emulsifying workshop of Kailuan (Group) Chemical Co., Ltd. which is located at Guye District of Tangshan, Hebei Province; 13 operators were trapped at the site of the explosion.


To date, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued, and rushed to the hospital for immediate medical treatment, while emergency rescue operations are still ongoing for the other 12.


It is understood that the scene of the explosion has been sealed. The local public security, firefighting, medical and other departments are carrying out rescue operations at the scene at this time.


Eye witnesses said that there was a loud bang when the explosion occurred, and a mushroom cloud rose instantly.

(Reporter: Cui Wei) Since he made his debut 15 years ago, Jay Chou would release a new album every year, but surprisingly, he failed to do so last year.


His fans did not protest however; instead, they sent their blessings because the reason Jay Chou failed to release a new album was because he became a father.


After waiting for a year and a half, Jay Chou finally arrived in Beijing to present his first works since becoming a father. It was also the 14th album in his music career, “Jay Chou’s Bedtime Stories”.


US media: Scientists from the Air Force Engineering University of China looking into laser satellite to clean up space debris


Reference News January 18 report US media claims that Chinese scientists have put forward a daring and innovation proposal - to use large lasers to clean up the messy Earth orbit, and destroy old satellites as well as other space debris.


A January 15 report on US “Newsweek” website stated that researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China have written a thesis on “Research on de-orbiting model of small scale space debris removal using space-based laser”. This thesis described how by using space-based platform lasers, space debris would be rendered smaller and less dangerous as a result of laser radiation.


The report claimed that for years, space debris has always been a matter of concern for international space agencies. NASA has considered many alternative plans to track, probe and remove human made debris.


The methods for cleaning up large space debris include using an enormous net to clean up and collect the debris, as well as using magnetic material to suck them out of the orbit. Chinese scientists have conducted a laser simulation study and arrived at the following conclusion. This will be an effective method for cleaning up the Earth’s orbit.


The abstract of the thesis claimed that “(the simulated study) has provided the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space debris removal by using space-based laser.”


A 2014 research conducted by US defense industry giant Lockheed Martin revealed that as far as orbiting satellites are concerned, approximately 200 deterrents exist daily.


The high-speed debris of orbiting satellites are regarded as serious threats to future space missions, and have been described by European Space Agency experts as a “series of fatal threats”. High-speed debris has continued to rise annually over the years.


According to a January 17 report on the US-based “Popular Mechanics” website, space is basically empty, but space around Earth has become increasingly crowded. Every satellite we send into space will ultimately become debris orbiting Earth. As time passes, these debris will accumulate.


As debris increase, the probability of a satellite that is still operating normally being hit by debris becomes higher, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of US dollars.


The report claimed that all space agencies have formulated plans to remove space debris in the future.


NASA is considering firing atmospheric gases to reduce the speed of the debris so that it would de-orbit. Europe is looking at launching a satellite with a large net to capture the debris and it back to earth. Japan’s idea is to use a power chain to capture the debris.


At this time, China has also put forward a method of solving the space debris problem, and that is, to use a large laser to shrink the floating space debris into smaller, less harmful pieces.


According to a thesis published in German magazine “Optics”, a group of researchers at the Air Force Engineering University of China claimed that installing such a laser on a satellite would be enough to effectively clean up space; at least, according to the simulated results, that is.


The report claimed that the only way to prove effectiveness is to carry out tests. Currently, there are no arrangements for such as mission, but sooner or later, someone will install a laser on a satellite and send it into space.


Once this is achieved, we can finally bid farewell to space debris problems for good.

Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs, slashes dividend to revive business


British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and slash its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it started another restructuring programme to tackle the pressures facing its business.


The job cuts, which Chief Executive John Fallon said will mostly come late in 2018 and in early 2019, are in addition to 4,000 roles lost in its previous restructuring.


Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394-million U.S.) in May in a third cost-cutting programme to try to revive a business hit by the rapid move to digital learning.


The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for the year was unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to 2.05 billion pounds.

Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide blast


A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing a Nato soldier and wounding several others, officials say.


Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement said.


Unconfirmed local reports say three civilians also died in the incident in the city's Qarabagh district.


The bombing is the latest violence to have hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque blast in Herat.


On Monday a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.


A Nato statement said that Thursday evening's blast happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "personnel-borne improvised explosive device."


The statement said that all those injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.


Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major source of concern to Nato forces based in nearby Bagram.


According to the United Nations, Afghanistan saw at least 1,662 civilian deaths in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of those in the capital.


At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shia district of Kabul.


The Taliban said they had carried out that attack.


On 31 May, a huge bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.


The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump weighs up whether to increase the number of US troops aiding the military and police in the country.


Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.


EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reversed a decision to delay an Obama-era rule requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.


The EPA announced the decision to go ahead with the so-called "2015 Ozone Designations" late on Wednesday, saying it showed the agency's commitment to working with states.


"We believe in dialogue with, and being responsive to, our state partners," EPA Chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.


Pruitt in June had announced the EPA's intention to delay the ozone designations - in which existing smog pollution is measured in parts of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet tougher air quality standard - by one year to October 2018.


A group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a suit on Tuesday saying the effort was illegal.


The administration of President Donald Trump has been seeking to roll back a wide array of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader agenda Trump says is aimed at sparking economic growth.


But the efforts have triggered pushback by Democratics and conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health.


The EPA's website says breathing air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" like asthma.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown


Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to stage the most compelling boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met each other for the first time Thursday.


They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.


After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top-five pound-for-pound list.


Garcia extended his right hand and said, "How you doing, champ?


Best of luck to you."


Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 on ESPN.


As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a potential showdown between the fighters would be "perfect sizing."


"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.


"I moved up for Broner [at 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.


I'm small for 140.


I want to come down to lightweight.


And he's got to move up to lightweight [135 pounds] and then we have a fight.


That's what the fans are asking for.


Let's give them that."


Lomachenko agreed.


"Boxing needs this fight."


Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy he has to have Lomachenko fight a 135-pound debut bout later this year to set up a date next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has interest in fighting the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell winner following their Sept. 23 lightweight title bout at the Forum.


"This fight could be on pay-per-view because all the fans have been asking about it," Garcia said, later expressing openness to fighting on whatever network offers the best financial package.


"We're the main names.


No other names can generate that kind of attention.


Whenever they're ready ... ."


Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a tremendous fighter," and may attend his Saturday bout.


But Lomachenko paused at lavish praise for Garcia, saying he thought the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry Mikey ... you wanted the knockout."


Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then box.


They both said they can feel the momentum building for their own bout.


"This is the fight to be made.


No other fight creates as much attention and buzz.


I'm more than happy to work at it," Garcia said.


Said Lomachenko: "I've waited for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.


It will be a great fight."

The position stated by National Development and Reform Commission officials as regards achieving the emission reduction target of the 11th Five-Year Plan ahead of time gives the steel industry, which has been subjected to power supply and production quotas, strong expectations of resumption of production.


Although steel plants, as of now, have yet to receive clear notification from local governments announcing that work related to energy conservation and emission reduction has ended, the industry expects that by around December 15, 2010, steel plants nationwide that have been subjected to production quotas will resume production successively. Steel prices could start to come under pressure.


A spokesperson from a private steel enterprise in Hebei told our reporter that notice to end power supply and production quotas has yet to be received at this time, but in reality, pressure on all enterprises have eased significantly when compared to that in September and October.


Some local governments in Hebei Province have repeatedly issued documents related to power supply and production quotas, and have adopted mandatory power shutdown measures to limit production.


The reporter learned from local enterprises that the steel plants of most regions in Hebei have resumed production at this time, and pressure from production quotas have eased.


Mysteel.com analyst Zhang Tieshan estimated that end-user demand for construction steel will gradually weaken as winter has already arrived in Northern China.


Coupled with the energy conservation and emission reduction program winds down, most steel plants will generally resume production by around December 15. Products will gradually make their way to markets across the country before New Year’s Day.


The increase in the supply of resources will exert some pressure on soaring steel prices.

New results of Sweden's asylum age assessment tests released


The latest results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden subjected to a new method of medically assessing their age show that over 80 percent tested were judged to be older than 18, but not everyone has faith in their accuracy.


Sweden's national Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started carrying out the tests earlier year.


They are designed to make age assessment during the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failings in assessing the correct age of some refugees claiming to be underage.


To date Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period between mid March until July 31st, 2017.


Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or over, while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the subject was "possibly 18 or over."


In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18."


The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is in question.


According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with previous months.


"We see no big difference in the statistics from previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.


The high proportion of cases judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about their age.


In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 instances that "suggest the person examined is 18 years or older."


When newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the 581 results released however it found that in 243 of the cases the person had openly stated that they turn 18 this year.


The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, then having dentists and radiologists analyse them, has also been criticised in some quarters.


One sceptic is Karolinska Institute endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty earlier or later than usual.


"I've had reason to think about this, and I don't think the type of measurement being used should be.


Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain.


If we can't say it for sure we shouldn't pretend that we can," he told newspaper Metro.


The Forensic Medicine Agency's Göransson defended the accuracy of the tests however: "In general you can say that the risk of inaccurately judging a child to be an adult is small.


The biggest risk is if the person is just under 18, in which case it's around 10 percent."


West Virginia governor announces he's switching parties


The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he's switching parties.


"Like it or not like it, the Democrats walked away from me," Gov. Justice said.


"Today I will tell you with lots of prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as West Virginians, I can't help you anymore being a Democratic governor."


The rally erupted in cheers.


"So tomorrow, I will be changing my registration to Republican," Justice added.


"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to run another play."


Mr. Trump promised earlier a big announcement at the West Virginia rally.


Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.


Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.


Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, having inherited a coal business from his father.


He's worth about $1.59 billion.


Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying "Governor Justice's party switch is another blow to a Democratic Party that would rather obstruct than work to make our country great again."


"With only 15 governorships and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just the latest rejection of a party that is leaderless from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Coe praises 'candid' Russian apology for doping scandal


Global athletics boss Sebastian Coe praised what he described as a candid apology from Russia over a doping scandal on Thursday but reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be readmitted to the sport.


Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told an IAAF Congress, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's ban from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.


He said he was sorry to "all athletes who have had gold and silver medals snatched from them at competitions."


Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favor of maintaining the ban, imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.


"I thought it was a very candid response today, a very candid presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.


"The whole Council and the whole Congress was pleased ... that the Russian federation recognized themselves that they have been through some pretty torrid times and are doing everything possible to make sure the federation is reengineered."


Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.


"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress is being made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this was not the moment to reinstate Russia," said Coe.


"We need to do everything over the next few months to normalize this situation.


The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added


Nineteen Russian athletes will be competing as neutrals at the World Athletics Championships which start in London on Friday, having met strict IAAF criteria.


The head of the IAAF's Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had yet to meet several of the criteria for reinstatement.


Drug-testing was still insufficient and banned coaches were still operating freely, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF Council.

In the overnight market, the US dollar experienced a V-shaped rebounded, ending at 90.8900 as of 07:30, Beijing time.


The Beige Book published by Federal Reserve shows that almost all 12 Fed regions reported mild to moderate growth in economic activity in early 2018. The Federal Reserve remains optimistic about the outlook for this year.


Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate remained at 4.1% in December, the lowest since 2000, and companies are expected to increase wages in the coming months.


Fed officials generally believe that tax reform is a factor supporting this modest strengthening of the economic outlook. The Fed predicts that the economy will increase by 2.5% in 2018 and the interest rate will be raised three times.


Some market observers have point out that the expected tightening of ECB’s monetary policy pushes up the exchange rate of the Euro in recent days. As a result, the US dollar index declines continuously, and the RMB exchange rate against the US dollar has seen a surge in prices. However, the European Central Bank is unlikely to adjust the policy stance soon. After the short-term fluctuation of the foreign exchange market, the exchange rates will eventually return to a level dictated by the fundamentals, and the continued smooth operation of the RMB exchange rate is a high probability event.


It is worth noting that, as the market expects a more stable renminbi, the attractiveness of renminbi assets to foreign investors will also gradually increase.

Today, four groups including Tonglu County, Zhejiang Province, which contributed to Beautiful China won the 8th China Environmental Award.


Established in 2000, the China Environmental Award is the most prestigious award in the field of environmental protection in China. The judging panel is made up of many Central government departments.


Li Wei, head of the judging panel and Secretary-General of China Environmental Protection Foundation said that China is now confronted with legacy ecological issues from a growth model that was GDP-heavy and environmental protection-light for a few decades.


The selection of the current China Environmental Award was aimed at honoring entities and individuals that have contributed to improving the environment and people’s livelihoods so as to reflect popular will.


As far as the judging panel was concerned, Tonglu County in Zhejiang Province which was founded on the basis of ecology should win this honor.

It was a fairly typical Taiwanese telecommunication network scam.


How soccer's financial rules impact Neymar's move to Paris


Rules aimed at preventing unfettered spending by European soccer clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world-record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.


Any consequences will come further down the line for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body overseeing the European game which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.


Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was funded without incurring huge losses.


Barcelona has been paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract and Neymar will command a salary that will run to tens of millions of dollars a year.


Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.


PSG can certainly stump up the cash to sign Neymar and add him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.


Clubs are allowed to spend heavily on acquiring players but they have to counterbalance that with legitimate sources of income, allowing them to approach break-even on their football-related business.


FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.


The former France player believed that clubs who ran up huge debts in their pursuit of success were effectively cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.


In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses instead.


The change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - buy a club with potential, and then spend heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - become a tougher proposition.


During the current three-year FFP assessment period that runs through 2018, clubs can incur losses of 30 million euros.


And despite Platini being ousted in disgrace from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin is still committed to deterring excessive spending.


"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will, for sure, reinforce the rules going forward," Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.


Although PSG will have paid Neymar's buyout clause in one lump sum, it can spread the amount for accounting purposes over the length of his contract.


Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee could be shown as a 44.4 million-euro cost in the annual accounts for the next five years.


The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 saw PSG, along with Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, hit with the heaviest sanctions.


PSG was handed a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million) - that was later reduced to 20 million euros - and ordered to limit its Champions League squads to 21 players for the 2014-15 season instead of the normal 25.


UEFA is on the lookout for clubs who might try to outwit its financial regulators by inflating their income through companies linked to a club's owners.


While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship was deemed to exceed standard market rates UEFA would not allow it to count as legitimate income.


That is what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the value of the Qatar Tourism Authority sponsorship of PSG was inflated.


It has been reported that part of Neymar's PSG earnings could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.


But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver would be easy for UEFA's regulators to expose.


Past sanctions slapped on PSG means that UEFA will be even more watchful of any attempt to circumvent the rules.


UEFA has not been in pre-emptive discussions with PSG about Neymar's transfer, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.


They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.


The last published accounts show that PSG made a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015-16 on a turnover of 542.4 million euros.


Accounts for the last financial year are yet to be published.


PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.


The club expects turnover would grow by at least 30 percent on the back of the signing.


Clearly irritated to see one of soccer's biggest players leaving, the Spanish league tried to stymie Neymar's move, claiming that PSG will be breaching FFP.


"It is a clear case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga President Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.


Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state funding a club.


"It is the consequence of the ownerships and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.


"Once a country owns a club, everything is possible.


It becomes very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play because you can have different ways or different interests for a country to have such a big player to represent a country."


Smart interactive robot developer Rokid received new investment; Temasek is the lead investor


In recent years, start-ups in the AI sector have continued to be a hot favorite of capital.


AI Rokid recently completed a round of funding, led by Temasek. Other investors included Credit Suisse, CDIB (the investment arm of China Development Financial Holdings Co., Ltd.), and existing shareholder IDG Capital.


It is understood that the size of this round of funding was approximately US$100 million. Both Credit Suisse and CDIB were first time investors in China’s domestic AI industry.


Rokid is a developer of smart interactive robots, and is committed to robotics research. It products can control smart devices in the home, and has continuous autonomous learning and growth functions. It also features recognition, comprehension and feedback functions.


Proceeds from this round of funding will be used for R&D, talent recruitment, strategic push and industry chain investment layout.


Rokid previously raised US$8.3 million in August 2014 in the Angel Round from IDG, Linear Venture, Mfund and Vision Capital. In October 2014, the company again received at least US$10 million in Series A funding led by Walden International, with the Angel investors as participants. On November 1, 2016, Rokid completed Series B funding, led by Advantech Capital; other investors included IDG, Mfund, Vision Capital and Walden International.


At the time, Rokid claimed that after the Series B funding, the company’s valuation would reach US$450 million.


In May 2017, Rokid unveiled its consumer class smart voice robot “Rokid - Pebble”, integrating AI and the home, priced at RMB1,399.


This robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology, with conversational, music broadcast and smart home features.


It has won two major CES awards - Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Video Components And Accessories, as well as Germany’s iF Design Award, known as the Oscars of the design world.


At the 2018 CES which had just ended, Rokid unveiled another new product: the consumer class augmented reality AR glasses RokidGlass.


These glasses are used as independent head displays, and do not require connections to smartphones or external computers. It is expected to be commercialized in 2018.


Previously, the company had already released its first generation home robot, RokidAlien and second generation product, smart voice box RokidPebble.

“Tofu”, a 3D animated feature film designed for a general audience held its premiere in Wuhan on the 25th. Zou Yi, Director of “Tofu”, Meng Zhihui, Animation Director of “Tofu”, as well as Tom Disher, film soundtrack composer and Emmy Award winner were present to share their behind-the-scenes story of the film’s creation.


“Tofu” is based on a traditional allusion concerning Liu An, Prince of Huainan in the Han Dynasty - “Liu An made a mistake and invented tofu”. It is an account of “Dou Fu”, the leading character, a bean who miraculously took on human form, how he overcame numerous difficulties and persevered in his dream to become an immortal. This adorable animated film about becoming an immortal is closely connected with Hubei’s local culture.


Wudang Mountains, located in Shiyan, Hubei Province, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as the place of origin of Toaist culture and Wudang martial arts. It is known as “a unique scenic spot since ancient times, and the premier celestial mountain in the world”.


Director Zou Yi revealed that he and his creative team traveled to Wudang Mountains to conduct research for the film prior to its creation.


He said that the story of “Tofu” occurred during the reign of Emperor Wu of Western Han Dynasty, against the backdrop of Liu An, Prince of Huainan, making pills to attain immortality. The leading character “Dou Fu” was a bean that miraculously took on human form by accident while Liu An was making these pills.


In addition to Wudang Mountains, the place of origin of Toaist culture, Hubei Province is also closely connected with the chime - a traditional musical instrument with long history in China.

Nostalgia Goes Niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"


So this iteration of the story is simultaneously nostalgic for the characters' '80s glory days; for the '90s grunge era (around when the masterminds David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV); and for itself - that is, for 2001, before its stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went on to bigger things.


As a cultural artifact, it's both a sendup and embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent reminiscence.


But as a franchise, it feels like it's running out of time.


"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurdist humor (it included an origin story for a talking can of vegetables, voiced by H. Jon Benjamin).


By doubling down on the core gag - middle-age actors playing horny kids coming of age - it made the impossibility of recapturing the past part of the joke.


"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody more scattershot, including a riff on '90s stalker flicks like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."


At one point a character rummages through an Apple Powerbook, some in-line skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."


Many of the core stories are the same.


Sweet-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn't gotten over Katie (Marguerite Moreau).


Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.


And there's another battily villainous plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now abetted by George H. W. Bush (a well-inhabited impression by Michael Ian Black).


As always, the best part of the franchise is the digressions.


It's especially fun to see the forever-young Mr. Rudd, sporting Matt Dillon's soul patch from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like a geezer.


It's the moments of random lunacy that might power this franchise on, like a kind of recursive "Seven Up!" series, until it reaches what I assume will be its logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will have the gang going to see the movie premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."


"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different brand of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW," with its East versus West wrestling iconography.


The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, with Rhys Thomas directing, purports to be found TV: a Romanian 1980s buddy-cop drama about two Bucharest officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist way.


The lead roles - hard-boiled Gregor and idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, their dialogue dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.


It's a brilliant idea.


But it's not much more than an idea.


There are some fine sight gags (the police pass the time watching chess on TV as Americans might football).


And the roster of famous voice-over actors - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game of spot-the-voice.


But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the verisimilitude of a hamfisted propaganda drama - a killer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like one.


At six long episodes, it drags, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.


Edited to a tighter length, "Comrade Detective" might deliver better on its agitprop satire, as when Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men wolfing down a pile of hamburgers.


The message, for the imagined communist audience, is that Western culture can turn anything into fodder to binge.


The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: We even do it with our own recent history, and theirs.


Reporters learned from recent interviews that the performance of the steel, rail transport, shipping vessel, machinery manufacture and other industries has fallen in general; some have even incurred losses.


Some experts believed that under the present circumstances, a new round of revitalization of the industries in Northeast China will not only concern the nation’s current economic recovery, it will also have an impact on the long-term growth and international competitiveness of China's manufacturing sector. Hence, there is an urgent call for adjustments and structural transformation to take place.


Traditional industries saw a general decline in performance, and even incurred losses. The raw material industry, and the heavy machinery and equipment manufacturing sector saw performance decline significantly, and even incurred losses. These were the first signs from the industries in Northeast China amid the current sluggish economy.


When the economy decelerated in the past, low-end and primary commodities were the most significantly affected. In the current economic fluctuation however, both high- and low-end industrial products of Northeast China’s traditional industries were affected.


A few years ago, Ansteel Group (Weibo) began by adjusting its product mix, and gave priority to developing high-end steel plates such as those for containers, railroad tracks, shipbuilding, and civilian home appliances. However, sales of these product categories fell significantly. In particular, the sales volume of steel plates for shipbuilding plunged 50% year-on-year.


Angang Steel Company (Hao Qingshun, Director of the Metallurgical Department of Liaoning Provincial Industry and Informatization Commission, said that metallurgy was the third largest pillar industry in Liaoning, with annual steel production capacity of 60 million tonnes, ranked third nationwide.


For the first five months of this year, crude steel production in Liaoning Province amounted to 21.54 million tonnes. Sales of products required by projects that were encouraged by national policy and where there was strong local government construction activity was better. Products in which market competition was more intense fell by a larger magnitude. This was another characteristic of Northeast China’s manufacturing sector.


In sharp contrast to being diligent and responsible on reaching adulthood, Daniel Wu was a very mischievous child, even rebellious.


The movie “Once Upon a Time”, soon to be released on August 4, held a press conference entitled “people from all corners of the world have come to meet you” to launch the movie in Beijing yesterday. On-screen “Bai Ye couple” Yang Yang (Ye) and Liu Yifei (Bai) were present at the conference.


Yang Yang, who underwent surgery on his right ear just a few days ago, made an appearance for the first time after his recuperation. He interpreted his character as someone who “does not wear his heart on his sleeve”, quietly giving his all to Bai Qian, and concealing all his feelings.


Yang Yang said that he had to rouse all his emotions to convey the character’s hidden sadness to the audience. “This was certainly a new challenge for me as an actor. While acting this character, I was so emotionally suppressed that I almost suffered internal injury”.


Liu Yifei, meanwhile, revealed that while acting her character in the movie, she cried so much that she collapsed at one point.


The Japanese Olympic Committee recently said that the Japanese delegation was targeted at 30 gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and making Japan into the Top Three.


In October last year, Chairman Yamashita Tasuhiro of the Athletes Commission of Japanese Olympic Committee expressed his expectation that the Japanese athletes can win 2.5 times more gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics than at the Rio Olympics.


At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Japanese delegation ranked 6th in the Gold List with 12 gold medals.


The representatives formed their own groupings, and walked to the venue holding umbrellas.


Traffic on the roads surrounding the venue remained normal. There were no balloons or slogans at the venue, nor a red carpet; displays of plants and fresh flowers were absent as well.


Yesterday, the second session of the fourth People’s Congress of Guang’an City convened without much ado.


On entering GuangAn International Convention and Exhibition Center, slogans were absent from the venue, and there were no tea cups; not even a bottle of mineral water was present.


Instead, there a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple recyclable paper document bag containing materials for the meeting and a recyclable paper cup for tea or water.


The meeting materials were less dense than that of the past. A few pieces of paper summarized the theme and the agenda of the meeting.


“Be thrifty for the people. Those whose duty are to be frugal must live frugally. A return to the current simple and down-to-earth meeting environment, we fully comprehend and welcome it.” GuangAn People’s Congress deputy Wang Cheng said that an efficient and practical meeting without formalism is what they want to see and in which they want to participate.


Experts pointed out that both inflationary and deflationary pressures have eased at this time. This was undoubtedly good news for the financial and economic structural transformation stage.


A total of 22 models of electric vehicles are sold at all major car dealers in California, but the selection in other states is a lot more limited. The second placed state only has 14 models while six states do not have any electric vehicles on sale.


February 10 news: Reporters learned yesterday from Changzhou Municipal Agricultural Committee that on basis of having successfully become a national forest city in 2016, Changzhou will thoroughly implement the “Master Plan for Establishing Changzhou National Forest City, Jiangsu Province (2014-2025)” this year so as to consolidate and upgrade the achievements from establishing a national forest city, and build a green, harmonious and high quality forest city that may be shared and enjoyed by all.


Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%


The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after lacklustre economic growth and easing inflation dampened speculation over a hike.


The Bank of England has warned economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it kept interest rates on hold amid a tightening squeeze on family incomes.


Policymakers on the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members this month calling for a rise as lacklustre economic growth has weakened support for a hike.


In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank cut its forecasts for growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and cautioned the squeeze on household incomes would continue, with inflation still expected to surge close to 3% in the autumn.


But it signalled rate hikes will be needed over the next few years to rein in Brexit-fuelled inflation and said borrowing costs may need to rise by more than expected in financial markets.


Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economy-boosting package unleashed a year ago in the aftermath of Brexit.


It will call time on the Term Funding Scheme to offer cheap-finance to banks from next February, although it said it was now expected to offer £15 billion more under the scheme - at £115 billion.


In minutes of the rates decision, the Bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains sluggish in the near-term as the squeeze on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."


On rates, it reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and by a "somewhat greater" extent than markets expect.


Markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.


But the Bank stressed that any hikes would be "gradual" and "limited."


The Bank's downgraded growth forecasts for this year and next compare with the 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.


It maintained its forecast for growth of 1.8% in 2018.


Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.


The pound was 0.5% down at 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.


The no-change decision comes after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened mounting expectations of a hike, with GDP edging up to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.


Growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to pick up slightly at the end of the year, according to the Bank.


Its latest inflation report offered little cheer for households being hit by soaring inflation and paltry pay rises as it said the squeeze will get worse before it gets better.


It added that monetary policy "cannot prevent" the hit to incomes over the next few years, but expects wages will recover "significantly" towards the end of its three-year forecast.


The economy is also set for a boost from surging demand for British goods thanks to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.


The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shock EU referendum vote, which sent the pound slumping.


The Bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully feed through to prices and the economy.


Prior to the Bank's latest rates verdict, there had been growing clamour for a rate rise as inflation ramped up pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.


Inflation eased back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and will pick up once again over the coming months.


The Bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "entirely" down to the weak pound.


Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market looks set to become ever more competitive once more as lenders clamour for business and look to end the year in positive fashion.


The market looks particularly good for those who may be coming to the end of their existing deals as re-mortgages, many with fee-free options as well as low rates, become ever more popular."

NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000


Patients will be able to access a 'transformative' HIV prevention treatment from September following a High Court battle over funding the drug on the NHS.


NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk individuals by around 86 per cent, will now be provided by the health service through an initial three-year trial to an estimated 10,000 people.


It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year, which said the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite its claims that local authorities should fund it.


The move announced on Thursday was hailed as a 'major new intervention' by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a 'pivotal moment'.


Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start enrolling people, with more clinics joining in October before full implementation across England by April 2018.


Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of getting HIV.


Trials have shown PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission among those at-risk of infection.


Taking PrEP before sex means there is just enough of certain drugs in a person's body to prevent an HIV infection taking hold.


Such drugs can be taken every day or as soon as two hours before having sex.


Those eligible for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and those with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully receiving treatment.


Clinics will identify eligible participants who consent to the trial, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment.


People living and registered with a GP in England will also be able to enrol for potential participation at their local participating sexual health clinic.


The programme will cost £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to source the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.


The trial is designed to assess the full potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is targeted, taken up, and implemented on a large scale.


Mr Stevens said: 'This major new intervention should complement and supercharge the wide-ranging and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV.


It's another milestone in more than three decades' worth of progress in tackling one of humanity's major health challenges.'


Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: 'This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.


PrEP, if targeted properly at those in need and at risk, offers the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.


From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access via this NHS-funded trial in England to an empowering new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.


We warmly welcome this announcement.'


Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: 'The priority must now be to make sure that the trial is rolled out speedily across the country, and that no-one at risk of HIV is left behind.


Now that the PrEP trial drug has been procured, we're well on the way to protecting over 10,000 people at risk of HIV.'


Shadow public health minister Sharon Hodgson said: 'The start of the PrEP trial is welcome and long overdue after months of delays and heel-dragging by the Government.


The evidence shows just how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and ending the transmission of this life-changing infection.


This trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.


Now it is important that this trial is rolled out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are exposed to HIV and help take us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.'

Living the high life: mezzanine floor and clever design tricks have transformed this small Earls Court flat into a spacious home


Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for doing up property, downsized from a large home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.


It is on the first floor of a smart Queen Anne terrace - and it is a testament to the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and sold on.


"Before this, I was living with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," Joanne says.


"I was looking for something that was comparable for my price.


I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.


I fell in love with it and put an offer in that day."


Since the first viewing, the 1,000sq ft flat has had a complete overhaul.


Originally a one-bedroom property with a convoluted layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.


"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.


That was my requirement," she says.


To this end, she employed Erfan Azadi of Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio Duck & Shed to exploit the 12.5ft ceilings and create a home that wasn't only a development but a place for Joanne to live.


The ceiling wasn't quite tall enough to add two spaces on top of each other so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine that you could stand up in.


Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the brief.


"The steelwork is quite complicated," he explains.


"We had to arrange the spaces so that they stacked on top of each other without needing to hunch down.


It wasn't just building a simple platform, but cranking the steels so that they were at the right height for the function above or below."


This arrangement allowed Erfan to get two full-height rooms on top of each other in the space - with lots of added drama.


For the mezzanine, a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area below.


Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting all set the style for the scheme.


The use of mirrors plays a part in adding theatre, space and light.


A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it appear longer.


In the kitchen, the mirrored splashback feels like a window to another room.


At the entrance, mirrored units provide storage for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.


Giving the perception of a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room is being able to close off the kitchen when it's not in use.


Foldaway kitchens are nothing new.


What's unique about this one is that it's a garage-style lift-up door.


"A bit of engineering went into that," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.


"It's counter-weighted so that when you push the door up, it glides really easily."


Thanks to clever use of space and storage, Joanne gained an additional 16sq m, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.


"At the end of the day, floor space is what you are going to sell - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.


"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will walk in and do a calculation based on floor size."


Here they have managed to increase the floor space while using quality materials that give the space its luxurious edge.


"The materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.


"You don't fall in love with the electrical feeds in the walls.


These are important but they don't pull the heart strings."


It goes to show that through good design and increased square metreage, a flat can turn from something standard into something quite amazing.


In fact, like Joanne, you may choose not to leave.

July 26 news: On July 22, reporters learned from Hongqiao District that the upgrading project of the city’s largest downtown riverside linear park has been completed, and the park will be opened to the public free of charge.


The entire landscaped zone leveraged the existing natural ecology as well as the strengths of historical and cultural resources, and re-planning as well as upgrading and transformation was carried out on both banks of the South Grand Canal. Five riverside scenic spots along the river were created, namely, “Emperor Yongle’s Ferry Crossing Heritage Park”, “Wellington Plaza”, “Xintiandi Folk Street”, “Tianjin West Railway Station Gallery” and “Shuixi Artistic Heritage Green Corridor”.


Plastic paved pathways of approximately 1,500 meters with distance markers have been built in the green open space on both sides of the river bank between Jinhua Bridge and Xinsantiao Stone Bridge.


In addition to the flowers, plants and trees planted on both sides of the pathway, a children’s playground has been constructed, embellished with various groups of small sculptures.


As you walk along, you will see benches, paved pathways, bridges, riverside decks, sand pits for children to play in, and other amenities. These help integrate the green landscape and water sights into one, offering residents another place for leisure, fitness and entertainment.

Brothers fight over $500 million property empire


Two brothers are at war over one of Victoria's biggest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty.


Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Toorak mansion three doors from younger brother Paul, who has taken him to the Supreme Court over how their property and business assets will be sliced up.


Paul has wanted out of the family business since 2014 but an acrimonious argument is playing out in the Supreme Court over the break-up.


Together with their mother Anna the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, amassed since the family bought a Smith Street, Collingwood, shop in 1973.


There, the family founded Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail outlets.


It sold in 1999 for $85 million.


That money was sunk into property and the De Lutis portfolio now includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento development sites, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments, and suburban shopping centres.


Under an agreement with their late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the major driving force and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company assets and Paul about one-third.


A court filing says this translates to Colin owning property worth $316 million and Paul $176 million.


Dividing the properties and cash has proved the sticking point for Paul.


"The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I considered to be the best properties," he wrote in an initial court affidavit in 2015.


Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.


The brothers are also now fighting over who controls the existing business - which Paul alleges Colin has locked him out of.


Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some properties.


In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.


"My Italian heritage dictates that family is the most important priority," he wrote.


Costs are mounting in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer filed and top barristers including Allan Myers, QC, and senior solicitors retained by both sides.


Ms De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950s and in the early 1970s bought a shop in Brunswick.


They used the collateral to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.


Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was a young child (around 10 years old)."


Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass down their properties to their sons amicably.


"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.


Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin saying that Mark was paid $10 million when he left the business, and Luke $26 million.


Both Luke and Mark had become, Paul says, "bitter about the terms of their financial separation."


Colin has kept a low profile despite being a former AFL club board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.


Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis on Friday, and their lawyers.


Only Colin replied, by text message, to say that because the case was before the courts "I really cannot say much."


"It's very, very sad that my brother Paul has chosen to sue me and drag our family name through the courts," he wrote.


In mid-2016, Colin wrote in one court filing that he had tried to accommodate his brother's requests.


"Our father would not have wanted to see Paul and I end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he was "still hopeful of resolution."


On Friday, that hope appeared gone.


"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
